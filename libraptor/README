OVERVIEW

   Raptor is the RDF Parser Toolkit for Redland and currently consists of
   two  parsers:  RDF/XML  and N-Triples. Raptor is designed to integrate
   closely  with Redland and also work entirely standalone, in which case
   it will use simple internal routines to perform the functions.

   This  library  is  Beta quality - most things work but there are known
   problems. See the todo list for more information. Changes can be found
   in the NEWS file or more detailed changes in the ChangeLog.

RAPTOR RDF/XML PARSER

     * An  RDF/XML  Parser  written  in C designed to integrate well with
       Redland
     * Can extract RDF content embedded in XML (such as XHTML)
     * Handles RDF Core WG syntax updates for XML Base and xml:lang
     * Generates N-Triples supporting XML literals and language tagging
     * Handles rdf:resource / resource attributes
     * Uses  expat  and/or  (GNOME)  libxml  XML  parsers as available or
       required
     * Provides features to select options at run time.
     * (Perl, Python, Java, Tcl, Ruby interfaces when used via Redland)
     * No memory leaks
     * Fast

   This  is  beta  quality  software  - the APIs may change, it is mostly
   feature complete but needs more testing for conformance.

RAPTOR NTRIPLES PARSER

   A  parser  for  the N-Triples format which emits RDF statements and is
   used by the RDF Core working group for test cases.

DOCUMENTATION

   There  is  no  documentation  at  present,  only the rdfdump.c example
   program  source  to  see  how  to call the parser. When raptor is used
   inside  Redland,  the  Redland  documentation explains how to call the
   parser and contains several example programs.
