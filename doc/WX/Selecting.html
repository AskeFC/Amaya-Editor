<h2>Selecting</h2>

<h3>Selecting with Keyboard and Mouse</h3>

<p>Many commands in Amaya act on the current selection. You can make a
selection using the keyboard or the mouse, as described below.</p>

<p>No matter how you make the current selection, Amaya displays the type of
the first selected element at the bottom of the window, followed by the types
of the enclosing elements in the structure. This may be helpful when the
document structure is complex.</p>

<p>For example, selecting a word in this sentence means that the status bar
reads</p>

<p><samp>text \ p \ div \ body \ html</samp></p>

<p>meaning that the thing selected is some text within a <code>p</code>
element (which is within a <code>div</code> element, etc.)</p>

<p>Selecting <strong>this structure element</strong> (for example click on
the word structure, then press <kbd>f2</kbd> gives</p>

<p><samp>strong \ p \ div \ body \ html</samp></p>

<h3>Selecting with the mouse</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To move the insertion point, click with the left mouse button.<br />
  </li>
  <li>To select some text, drag across a region: hold down the left mouse
    button, move the mouse, and release the button when the desired text is
    selected.<br />
  </li>
  <li>To select an entire word, double-click on any character of a word.<br />
  </li>
  <li>To select a whole element such as a list item, click its bullet or
    number.<br />
  </li>
  <li>To extend the selection, click with the left mouse button while holding
    down the <code>Shift</code> key.</li>
  <li>To select a structure element, click within the element you want and
    then select the desired structure level via the keyboard as described
    below</li>
</ul>

<h3>Selecting Images</h3>

<p>Use the following procedures to select an image, or to move the cursor to
left or right of an image</p>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select an entire image:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click and drag anywhere within the image, and then release the mouse
    button. Be sure not to drag outside the image before releasing the
  mouse.</li>
  <li>Use the copy, cut, and paste commands to move or duplicate the image
    element along with all its attributes.</li>
</ol>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To place the cursor to the left or right of the
image:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the left part of an image to move the cursor to the left edge of
    that image. This enables you to type text before the image.</li>
  <li>Click the right part of an image to move the cursor to the right side
    of that image. This enables you to type text after the image.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureNote"><strong>Note:</strong>    When using the arrow keys,
the cursor moves from one side of the image, to the image itself (selecting
it), and then to the other side.</p>

<h3>Selecting by Structure</h3>

<p>The structure view is especially convenient for quickly selecting large
elements or groups of elements within a document.</p>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select an element:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are three ways to select a large element like a complex table or
    a long list with a single click: Click the blue label that represents the
    element, click the name of any of its attributes, or click the blue
    vertical line associated with that element.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select a text character or text string within
a structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click a text character in Structure view to select only that character.
    To select a text string, click and drag across the text.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select an attribute value:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Structure view, attribute values that can be edited from the
    keyboard are represented in bold text. Click and drag across the
    attribute value to select it. You cannot extend this type of text
    selection outside the attribute value.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select structure elements using the
keyboard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Press the <kbd>F2</kbd> key to select the parent element in the
    document structure. Press the key several times to select containers (and
    everything in them) up the structure towards the root.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd> (minus key) to select a child element.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl k</kbd> to select the next element at the same level,
    or at the level of the parent element if there is no next or previous
    child of the current level.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl j</kbd> to select the previous element at the same
    level, or at the level of the parent element if there is no previous
    child of the current level.</li>
</ul>
