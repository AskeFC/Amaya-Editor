<h2>Creating Elements in Amaya</h2>

<h3>Buttons and Types Menu</h3>

<p>The commands on the <strong>XHTML</strong> and <strong>XML</strong> menus,
and the corresponding buttons, let you create new elements at the insertion
point within the document. To use the commands from the
<strong>XHTML</strong> and <strong>XML</strong> menus, place the cursor at
the desired position and choose the element type from
the<strong>XHTML</strong> and <strong>XML</strong> menus.</p>

<h3>Insertion points</h3>

<p>When creating new elements, it is important to select an <em>insertion
point</em>, not some text nor a single character: if the current selection is
not empty, Amaya tries to <em>transform</em> the selected part into the
element type chosen.</p>

<h3>Element Locations</h3>

<p>Sometimes elements cannot be created at the chosen chosen because of the
constraints imposed by the HTML DTD. Amaya then tries to create the element
at the closest position. For example, if the insertion point is at the end of
the last line of a paragraph when you click on the Heading 2 button <img
src="../../resources/icons/22x22/XHTML_H2.png" alt="H2 Button" />, Amaya creates the new heading
after the paragraph.</p>

<p>In some other cases, Amaya changes the existing structure for creating the
desired element. If the insertion point is somewhere within a list item
(<kbd>li</kbd>) when you create a second level heading, the list item and its
enclosing list are automatically split, in order to create the requested
heading at the chosen position and to comply with the HTML DTD.</p>

<h3>Structure submenu</h3>

<p>The <strong>XHTML</strong> menu enables you to create only elements that
are part of the document <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. To create elements in the
document <code>HEAD</code>, use the <strong>Structure</strong> submenu from
the Structure view. This menu works in the same way as the
<strong>Types</strong> menu: put the cursor at the desired position and
choose the element type from the <strong>Structure</strong> submenu.</p>

<p>The <strong>Structure</strong> submenu also enables you to create
comments, using <strong>Comments</strong>. Comments are shown only in the
Structure view, but they can be inserted at any position in the document.</p>

<h3>Generated elements</h3>

<p>Some HTML elements are constituted by several other elements of different
types. For instance, a table usually contains a caption
(<code>caption</code>), several rows (<code>tr</code>), and several cells
(<code>td</code> or <code>th</code>) in each row.</p>

<p>When Amaya creates such elements, it also creates their components. A
table is created with a caption and a row containing a single cell. The
insertion point is placed automatically in the first of these components. You
can enter the content of that component immediately or later. You can move to
the next (empty) component with the mouse or with the arrow keys.</p>

<h3>The Enter (or Return) Key</h3>

<p>When you are writing a new document or a new part in a document, you can
create elements sequentially by pressing the <strong>Enter</strong> (or
<strong>Return</strong>) key. The current element is terminated and a new one
is created immediately after.</p>

<p>Most often, the new element created is simply a paragraph, whatever the
type of the previous element. You can change the element type by selecting
the desired type from the <strong>XHTML</strong> menu or by clicking the
corresponding button.</p>

<p>When a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> formatted element is at the end of the
document and the cursor is at the end of that element, hitting the Enter key
creates a new line in the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>. To create another
element, say a paragraph, after the &lt;pre&gt;, you have to select the whole
<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element with the <kbd>F2</kbd> key and to press
Enter.</p>

<p>In the same way, you can create a new paragraph after the table by
selecting the whole table and pressing Enter.</p>

<p>When a whole element like <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;li&gt;</code> is selected the Enter key creates a new
<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> after.</p>

<h3>Exiting Anchors, Styled Character Strings, etc.</h3>

<p>When a paragraph or another block of text is styled terminated by an
anchor or a character string in bold, italic or other such style moving the
insertion point to the end and typing new text appends characters to the
anchor or the styled string.</p>

<p>To exit an anchor or styled element and enter plain text:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Move the cursor to the end of the anchor or style element, and then
    press <b>Enter</b> and continue typing after the element.</li>
  <li>The same method can be used to enter plain text at the beginning of a
    block starting with an anchor or styled characters. Move the cursor to
    the beginning of the anchor or style element, and then press <b>Enter</b>
    and continue typing before the element.</li>
</ol>

<p>To get out of a &lt;pre&gt; or a table:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the cursor is at the end of a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> formatted,
    hitting the <b>Enter</b> key creates a new line in the
    <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>. To create another element, say a paragraph,
    after the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, you can use the
    <strong>XHTML</strong> menu and select the type of the element you want
    to create.</li>
  <li>Another way to achieve this result is to select the whole
    <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element with the <code>F2</code> key) and to
    press <b>Enter</b>. This creates a new paragraph after the
    <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element.</li>
</ul>

<p>This works also for a table: select the whole table and press <b>Enter</b>
to create a new paragraph after the table. You can also get out of a table by
pressing Enter until you are out of the table.</p>

<h3>Creating Nested Structures</h3>

<p>When the insertion point is in an empty element, pressing the
<strong>Enter</strong> key replaces that element by another empty element at
the next higher level in the document structure. This feature allows you to
create complex, nested structures very quickly.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first item in the list
    <p>A paragraph in the first item</p>
  </li>
  <li>The second item in the list.
    <ul>
      <li>First item in the nested list.</li>
      <li>Second item in the nested list.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Last item in the list</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To create the above structure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the <strong>Bullet List</strong> button to create the first item
    in the list.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Type in the list item text, and press the <strong>Enter</strong> key
    once. Amaya creates a new paragraph within the list item.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Type the paragraph text, and press the <strong>Enter</strong> key
    twice. The first <strong>Enter</strong> creates another paragraph
    element, but the second <strong>Enter</strong> removes that paragraph and
    creates a second bullet list item in the original list.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Type the second list item.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Bullet List</strong> button to create a new list. The
    new list is automatically nested within the first list.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Type the text for the first item in the new list, and press the
    <strong>Enter</strong> key twice to create a new item in the nested list.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Type the text for the second list item, and press the
    <strong>Enter</strong> key four times to create a new list item in the
    original list.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Type the final list item, and then press the <strong>Enter</strong> key
    three times to close the original list and start a new paragraph.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>Enter</strong> key works in the same way when the insertion
point is at the beginning of an element, but it creates new elements before
the current element. For example, to add a list item between the first two
items in the above structure, place the cursor at the beginning of the second
list item, and press the <strong>Enter</strong> key twice.</p>

<p class="Note"><b>Note</b>:  This use of the <strong>Enter</strong> key does
not apply only to lists and paragraphs, but to all elements. For example, it
is very helpful for creating tables.</p>

<h3>Changing the Document Title</h3>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To edit the document title:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the <strong>XHTML</strong> menu and choose <strong>Change
    Title</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Note" style="text-indent: 15pt"><b>Note:</b>    <br />
You can also edit the document title from the Structure view.</p>
