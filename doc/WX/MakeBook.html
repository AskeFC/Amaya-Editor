<h2 id="Assembling">Assembling large document collections</h2>

<p>The <strong>Make book</strong> command in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu
is used to assemble large document collections into a single volume.</p>

<p>Amaya enables you to handle document collections. Such a collection may,
for example, represent a set of technical documentation made up of several
web pages. </p>

<p>One of the web pages contains the title of the entire documentation set
(an <code>h1</code> element), an introduction (some other elements), and a
list <code>ol</code> or <code>ul</code> whose items <code>li</code> contain
links to each chapter. Chapters are separate documents that can have a
similar structure.</p>

<p>This organization is useful for browsing, but has several drawbacks when
the entire documentation set must be printed. Amaya addresses this problem
with the <strong>Make book</strong> command (<strong>Tools/Make
book</strong>).</p>

<p>You use typed links for linking chapters, by associating an attribute
<code>rel="chapter"</code> or <code>rel="subdocument"</code> with the anchor
that refers to a chapter (to do this, select the <code>a</code> element and
use the <strong>Attributes</strong> panel).</p>

<p>Each referred chapter or sub-document can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an external document</li>
  <li>a subset of a larger external document</li>
</ul>

<p>To refer to a document subset, you usually define a <code>div</code>
element to identify the part of the target document you want to include, and
to link to this target element.</p>

<p>Then, when you activate the <strong>Make book</strong> command, all blocks
(<code>li</code> elements in the above example) containing a typed link to a
chapter will be replaced by the corresponding actual web pages (or web page
subsets), and Amaya will display a unique document containing the whole
collection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the link refers to a web page, Amaya includes all the
    <code>body</code> content of the target document.</li>
  <li>If the link refers to a target element, Amaya includes this element
    with its content.</li>
  <li>If the link refers to a target anchor, Amaya includes the content of
    the anchor, but not the anchor itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before each replacement, the <strong>Make book</strong> command generates
a new <code>div</code> element with an <code>id</code> attribute to clearly
separate each added piece.</p>

<p>Pieces of the new generated document can contain normal links, target
anchors, and target elements. During the <strong>Make book</strong>
operation, Amaya ensures that each <code>name</code> and <code>id</code>
attribute value remains unique in the new document. As needed, Amaya changes
these values and updates any relative links.</p>

<p>At the same time, Amaya automatically updates external links from
referring to an external document or document subset, to referring to the
text that is now included. For example, if the link originally pointed to an
external document, the link will now refer to the  <code>div</code> element
generated by the <strong>Make book</strong> command. This ensures that the
new unique document containing the whole collection and remains coherent.</p>

<p>This large document can then be numbered and printed with a complete table
of contents and a list of all links.</p>
