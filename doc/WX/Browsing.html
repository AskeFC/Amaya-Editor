<h2>Browsing with Amaya</h2>

<p>Amaya is mainly an editor with browsing capabilities. It allows you to
open and browse Web documents simulteneously. Browsing with Amaya is similar
to browsing with other Web browsers except for <a
href="#Activating">activating a Link</a>.</p>

<p>Amaya allows you to to display HTML documents as well as some XML document
types: XHTML, MathML (mathematics expressions) and SVG (gaphics). It also
allows you to acceed other XML document types and to display their content
according to attached CSS style sheets. For these XML documents some editing
functions are available.</p>

<p class="Note">This behavior can be changed through the <strong>Browsing
Preferences</strong> dialog under the <strong>Edit&gt;Preferences</strong>
menu. By changing the <strong>Double click activates link</strong> option,
you can browse documents with a single click as you would in a traditional
Web browser. However, you will not be able to edit a link by clicking within
it.<br />
Other browsing preferences like the loading of images and the application of
CSS can be controled in the <strong>Browsing Preferences</strong> <a
href="../html/configuring_amaya/menu_preferences.html#Browsing">menu</a>.</p>

<h3>Note about character sets</h3>

<p>Amaya reads HTML and XHTML documents differently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Amaya reads HTML documents by default as <a
    href="../html/editing_iso-latin-1_characters/entering_ISOLatin1_characters_in_amaya.html">ISO-Latin-1</a>
    files. If an author does not provide information about the character set
    (charset) in the HTTP header or in a META element, Amaya considers an
    HTML document to be encoded in ISO-Latin-1.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Amaya reads XHTML documents by default as UTF-8 files. If an author
    does not provide information about the charset in the HTTP header, in the
    XML declaration, or in a META element, Amaya considers an XHTML document
    to be encoded in UTF-8.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the default charset is different for HTML and XHTML documents,
authors often create documents using the incorrect charset. For example,
consider an XHTML document that uses ISO-Latin-1 but does not provide
information about the charset. When the XML parser analyzing the document
encounters a character that does not match a valid UTF-8 character, the
document is considered to be not well formed. Parsing stops and Amaya
displays an error message that proposes either to reload the document as an
HTML document or to show parsing errors. If show parsing errors is selected,
Amaya displays the detected errors.</p>

<h3>Opening Documents</h3>

<p>You can open both local or remote documents in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open a document in the current window.</li>
  <li>Open a document in a new window.</li>
  <li>Open a document from the <strong>Open</strong> field.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use these steps to create a new local document.</p>

<p>To open a document in the same window:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose <strong>Open Document</strong> from the <strong>File</strong>
    menu.
    <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can alternately use a keyboard
    shortcut to open a document. Press <kbd>Ctrl o ctrl o</kbd>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In the <strong>File Selection</strong> dialog, type the full path or
    URI of the file you want to open, or click <strong>Browse</strong> to
    open a file selection dialog.</li>
  <li>When the document is correctly specified, click
    <strong>Confirm.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>To open a document in the different window:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose <strong>Open in new window</strong> from the
    <strong>File</strong> menu.
    <p class="Note"><b>Note:</b> You can alternately use a keyboard shortcut
    to open a document. Press <kbd>Ctrl o Ctrl w</kbd>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In the file selection dialog, type the full path or URI of the file you
    want to open, or click <strong>Browse</strong> to open a file selection
    dialog.</li>
  <li>When the document is correctly specified, click
    <strong>Confirm</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To open a file from the <strong>Open</strong> field:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click and drag in the <strong>Open</strong> field to select the file
    name or the URI of the current document.</li>
  <li>Press the <strong>DELETE</strong> key, and then type the file name or
    the URI of the file you want to open and press
  <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="Activating" id="Activating">Activating a Link</a></h3>

<p>Links are normally displayed as blue or underlined text. Because Amaya is
both a browser and an editor, you get different results when you
single-click, double-click, or right-click a link.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single-click a link to move the cursor to that position in the
    document. The status bar displays the expanded URI of the link.</li>
  <li>Double-click a link to activate the link and go to its target. The
    document retrieved by this operation replaces the current document in the
    same window and in the same mode (editor or browser) as the original
    document. If the original document was modified and has not yet been
    saved, a "Lose all modifications" prompt displays.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Right-click a link to activate the link and open the target document in
    a new window. The original document remains open in the first window.</li>
  <li> class="Note"<strong>Note:</strong> <br />
    This behavior can be changed through the <strong>Browsing
    Preferences</strong> dialog under the
    <strong>Edit&gt;Preferences</strong> menu. By changing the <strong>Double
    click activates link</strong> option, you can browse documents with a
    single click as you would in a traditional Web browser. However, you will
    not be able to edit a link by clicking within it.<br />
    Other browsing preferences like the loading of images and the application
    of CSS can be controled in the <strong>Browsing Preferences</strong> <a
    href="../html/configuring_amaya/menu_preferences.html#Browsing">menu</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About Target Anchors</h3>

<p>Target anchors are pieces of text that have been given an ID or name
attribute. They identify possible targets for links.</p>

<p>So that you can easily recognize targets, you can turn on the display of
target icons <img src="../images/target.gif" alt="Target icon" />. These
icons are not part of the document and can be displayed or hidden in two
ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing <strong>Show targets</strong> from the <strong>Views</strong>
    menu.</li>
  <li>Using default keyboard commands (<kbd>Ctrl v Ctrl t</kbd> in Unix,
    <kbd>Ctrl u Ctrl t</kbd> in Windows).</li>
</ul>

<h3>About Moving Backward and Forward</h3>

<p>Amaya creates a history list to keep track of the pages you have viewed in
the current session. You can move backward or forward through pages in the
history list in several ways:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>File menu</td>
      <td>Choose <strong>Back</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu to
        view the previous page.

        <p>Choose <strong>Forward</strong> from the <strong>File</strong>
        menu to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Keyboard shortcuts</td>
      <td><b>Unix</b>:

        <p>Press <kbd>Alt b</kbd> to view the previous page.</p>

        <p>Press <kbd>Alt f</kbd> to view the next page.</p>

        <p><b>Windows</b>:</p>

        <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl b Ctrl b</kbd> to view the previous page.</p>

        <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl b Ctrl f</kbd> to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Button bar</td>
      <td>Click the <img alt="Back" src="../images/Back.gif" /> button to
        view the previous page.

        <p>Click the <img alt="Forward" src="../images/Forward.gif" /> button
        to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Reloading a page</h3>

<p>Documents can be reloaded by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing <strong>Reload</strong> from the <strong>File</strong>
  menu.</li>
  <li>Using the shortcut <kbd>Alt r</kbd> in Unix and <kbd>Ctrl r</kbd> in
    Windows.</li>
  <li>Clicking the <strong>Reload</strong> button <img
    src="../images/Reload.gif" alt="reload" /> on the button bar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About Access Keys</h3>

<p>Access keys provide shortcuts for moving the cursor to a form field, an
area, or a link. Such access can be crucial to people with motor
disabilities, but there are other conditions where it could be necessary or
useful.</p>

<p>When developing a web document, you can associate the
<code>accesskey</code> attribute with the following elements:
<code>AREA</code>, <code>BUTTON</code>, <code>INPUT</code>,
<code>LABEL</code>, <code>LEGEND</code>, and <code>TEXTAREA</code>.</p>

<p>For example, if you associate the <code>accesskey</code> attribute with a
link in a document using <code>accesskey="n"</code> or
<code>accesskey="N"</code>, the command <kbd>Alt accesskey</kbd> (<kbd>Alt
n</kbd> or <kbd>Alt N</kbd>) will activate that link. If you associate the
<code>accesskey</code> attribute to a form element, pressing Alt accesskey
moves the focus to that element (or to the following element if associated
with a <code>LABEL</code> and <code>LEGEND</code> element).</p>

<p>Access keys overwrite Amaya shortcuts. For example, the Amaya Help pages
declare these access keys:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"n" for going to the next page</li>
  <li>"p" for going to the previous page</li>
  <li>"t" for the table of contents</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have assigned the shortcut <kbd>Alt-p</kbd> to an Amaya command,
this shortcut won't be accessible when the Amaya Help pages are displayed.</p>

<p>By default, Amaya uses the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key as the modifier for access
keys. However, you can change this default using the<strong></strong><span
style="color: #0000FF"><strong>Edit&gt;Preferences&gt;General</strong></span>
dialog box. You can choose the <kbd>Control</kbd> key instead of the
<kbd>Alt</kbd> key for a modifier, or you can disable the access keys
handler.</p>

<h3>Browsing forms</h3>

<p>As Amaya is a browser/editor, some of the widgets associated with HTMl
form elements are different from those you are used to in browsers. This
section mentions the most notable differences.</p>

<h3>Form input selector, single selection (GTK and WIN32 only)</h3>

<p>To activate the selector, the user has to click twice on the entry. This
will result in a popup widget appearing showing all the entries. The widget
supports a user interaction both with the keyboard as well as with the
mouse.</p>

<p>With the keyboard, you must first select an entry using the arrow keys.
Pressing the Enter key will validate the choice. the Page Up and Page Down
keys allow the user to quickly scroll amont the list entries. You can abort
the action of this widget by pressing the F2 key anytime.</p>

<p>With the mouse, there are two kinds of behavior. A single click allows the
user to select an entry, whereas a double click on an entry means that the
user wants to activate the selection. To abort the action of the widget, you
just need to click in any area outside of the pop-up widget (N.B., this
option doesn't work yet on GTK). You can also use the scroll bar to quickly
navigate thru the widget entries.</p>

<h2>Form input selector, multiple selection</h2>

<p>The behavior of this widget is similar to the single selection one. That
is, the widget supports only one toggle of a selection state at the time. You
need to invoke it as many times as toggle changes you need. When the widget
is activated, it will show the current state of selections. On WIN32, this is
currently done by appending a '&gt;' character to the selected entries. On
GTK, this is done by means of a blue color bar. As before, you can abort the
widget by using either the F2 key or clicking elsewhere (only on WIN32
systems).</p>
