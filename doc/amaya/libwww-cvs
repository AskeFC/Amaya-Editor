NOTE:

If you don't want to try these version right now, make a copy of the
following files before making an update, or get the precedent version
from CVS. Otherwise, you won't be able to compile Amaya/libwww:

	query.c
	answer.c

Instructions for compiling Amaya with the cvs.w3.org/libwww

=== get libwww out of CVS===
cd ~
mv libwww libwww-opera (or destroy it)

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public -z3 checkout -rAmaya libwww

=== Bootstrap libwww
cd libwww
perl config/winConfigure.pl 

Additional step for UNIX platformsw:

aclocal ; autoheader ; automake ; autoconf ;

==== Compile it (Unix Platforms)
cd ~/Amaya/obj
rm -r libwww.a libwww
make amaya

This will create a new libwww directory and lots of mini libwww*.a files
If you want to recompile libwww, you'll have to make a

   cd ~/Amaya/obj
   rm -r libwww*

next time
===============

Compile it (Windows Platforms)

Add the modules/md5, modules/expat/xmltok, modules/expat/xmlparse
files to the project.
Undefine the symbol WWW_WIN_DLL in the settings for libwww.
The rest of the settings are the same as for the precedent libwww (see
Vanuatu).

Self remainder. Windows files I had to change:

Library/src/windows/config.h
Library/src/HTZip.c
Library/src/HTUtils.html
