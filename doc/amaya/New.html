<p>This file indicates the new features you can find in the latest versions of
Amaya.</p>

<h1>Amaya 2.3</h1>

<p>15 December, 1999</p>

<h2>Compatibility changes</h2>
If you had defined your own profiles in your amaya user directory, the
function TtcCloseDocument must be replaced by CloseDocument.

<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML:
    <ul>
      <li>As many search engines generate invalid forms, such forms are now
        supported.</li>
      <li>HTML and XHTML files are saved in ISO-Latin-1 (a single character is
        generated instead of é for instance). When saving a document, a META
        element is added in the document HEAD to specify Content-Type and
        Charset.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MathML:
    <ul>
      <li>When saving entities Amaya keeps the names that were read at
        downloading. As an example, &it; is no longer replaced by
        &InvisibleTimes;</li>
      <li>You can enter large symbols (parentheses, integrals, arrows, etc.)
        directly from the keyboard or from the Greek palette.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CSS:
    <ul>
      <li>More complex CSS selectors are supported, including several ancestor
        elements as well as an attribute from an ancestor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>User Interface:
    <ul>
      <li>The content of the TITLE element is displayed as the window title
        instead of the filename.</li>
      <li>Amaya provides now an horizontal scroll bar when the document
        includes images or tables larger then the current window size.</li>
      <li>Shortcuts Control Up, Control Down, Control Left, Control Right
        smoothly scroll the document in the four directions.</li>
      <li>When a document has been read as XHTML, it is saved by default as
        XHTML.</li>
      <li>When some text is pasted from another application line breaks are
        kept in the HTML document.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>libwww:
    <ul>
      <li>It's now possible to say that the proxy should ONLY be used with a
        given list of domains.</li>
      <li>You can now declare the proxy using just the server's name and it's
        optional port (no need to prefix it with the http:// string as
      before)</li>
      <li>Improved the Accept: string for doing image and css content
        negotiation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Internationalization:
    <ul>
      <li>There is now an Italian version of Amaya. Many thanks to Roberto
        Bagnara.</li>
      <li>Dutch, German, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish dictionaries are now
        available for the Amaya spell-checker. We are not able to evaluate the
        quality of these dictionaries, but we hope they can help. Comments
        welcome.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Building Amaya:
    <ul>
      <li>There are new make files for the Windows platforms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GTK:
    <ul>
      <li>You can now build a GTK version of Amaya. In this version GTK
        replaces Motif. Implementation is not complete yet and contributions
        are welcome. This version is currently only able to display document
        views and many user actions are disabled. See Autoconf.html to learn
        how to build this version.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Many memory leaks and resource leaks are fixed in the Windows
  version.</li>
  <li>User Interface:
    <ul>
      <li>when Backspace deleted a string, the final position of the cursor
        was wrong.</li>
      <li>the Delete command on an empty paragraph didn't do anything. So it
        was impossible to merge two paragraphs with the Delete command.</li>
      <li>when the selection was moved down with the arrow key, it was shifted
        one position to the right and the cursor was stuck on HR
      elements.</li>
      <li>on Windows platforms each Return inserted two empty paragraphs
        instead of one.</li>
      <li>the Windows kill command ([X]) closed the document window before
        proposing to save a modified document. So Cancel was ineffective.</li>
      <li>some Amaya crashes are fixed now.</li>
      <li>the history associated to the Forward and Back buttons sometimes was
        corrupted.</li>
      <li>added more explicit messages related to the failure of PUT
        operation.</li>
      <li>the authentication dialogue now displays the authentication and
        server realm (both data were previously displayed in the status
        field).</li>
      <li>After a Synchronization or a Save from the Source view images were
        lost in the formatted view.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>HTML:
    <ul>
      <li>Element <input type=image>
         was not well supported.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cache:
    <ul>
      <li>Spaces in the cache directory path were being ignored.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Amaya 2.2</h1>

<p>26 October, 1999</p>

<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>CSS:
    <ul>
      <li>Amaya is now able to print with CSS. By default Amaya takes into
        account style sheets when printing. The entry "Ignore style sheets"
        allows one to print documents like in previous Amaya version.</li>
      <li>For a better mapping with CSS, language P has been extended. Style
        and Weight are now two separate properties. This allows Amaya to
        handle the corresponding CSS properties (font-style, font-weight)
        independently and to display text both italic and bold.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A Source view is now available from the Views menu. When you select in
    the main view, an index points at the corresponding markup in the source
    view and conversely. You can edit the source code. Every time you save the
    source code or you activate the Synchronize entry of the Files menu, the
    other views are updated to reflect the latest changes.</li>
  <li>Four different Amaya profiles are proposed: editor, mini-editor,
    browser, mini-browser. Amaya menus and buttons are displayed according to
    the current profile.</li>
  <li>User Interface:
    <ul>
      <li>The backspace deletes the current selection when that selection is
        not empty and delete the previous character in other cases.</li>
      <li>If there is no selection in the document which receives the current
        focus and the user hits any arrow key, a selection is automatically
        generated at the window top.</li>
      <li>A new option in the Preferences/Publishing menu allows to declare a
        set of domains where a PUT may be redirected, and thus avoid having a
        popup asking a user to confirm each redirection.</li>
      <li>It's now possible to define a shortcut to follow a link or activate
        a form element (menu, submit, reset): the name of the function is
        DoAction and the default shortcut is "Alt Return".</li>
      <li>A new command "Link previous target" allows one to create a link to
        the latest created target. The default shortcut is "Ctrl Shif L".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A mechanism of templates allows you to experiment templates provided by
    the W3C server or to install your own template server. To use the sample
    W3C template server, open the Special/Preferences/Templates menu and type
    in the following URL: http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/createform.pl. Quit Amaya
    and there'll be a new option in the File/New submenu: From template.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User Interface:
    <ul>
      <li>It was impossible to cancel the creation of a link. Now the second
        button in the creation popup is 'Cancel' instead of 'Done', and when
        that button is pressed, the whole action is cancelled.</li>
      <li>Improvement of attribute menus.</li>
      <li>There was a confusion in the button bar.</li>
      <li>With an extended selection the right arrow and the bottom arrow
        moved the selection relatively to the beginning of the selection
        instead of the end.</li>
      <li>Empty Math boxes were not displayed on Windows platforms.</li>
      <li>The cancel button didn't always work in the Windows authentication
        dialogue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CSS:
    <ul>
      <li>When the color was invalid Amaya used the black. Now the CSS rule is
        ignored.</li>
      <li>CSS comments within style elements were lost.</li>
      <li>The CSS parser didn't supported TABs in CSS style sheets or STYLE
        elements.</li>
      <li>Amaya misinterpreded complex selectors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SGML entites and spaces weren't being handled correctly when saving a
    document or when browsing a URL.</li>
  <li>Hexadecimal entity references were not recognized by the HTML and XML
    parsers.</li>
  <li>Relative URLs beginning with a "../../ " path were being simplifed into
    "../"</li>
  <li>When a Unix user launched Amaya with a not existing local file, Amaya
    displayed a form to create a new document, but that form didn't work well.
    If the user opened the document, the File menu was broken. If the user
    cancelled the form the application wasn't closed.</li>
  <li>When printing, parentheses that are part of mathematical expressions
    were misplaced on the page.</li>
  <li>Amaya could get stuck when creating an anchor.</li>
  <li>Some memory leaks in the Windows version are fixed. There was a memory
    leak when the download of a distant image failed.</li>
  <li>Amaya could crash if you had a single document window with pending net
    requests and you closed it.</li>
  <li>The replace string in the Search/Replace command could be lost.</li>
  <li>The root element HTML supports the attribute lang now.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Opening the source view of an HTML document which doesn't have an
    extension and which includes an image having the same name as that of the
    document, may result in the opening of the image source, rather than that
    of the document. Under Windows, this may happen even if the the document
    and the image's names only differ in case.</li>
  <li>Amaya doesn't saves yet the current positions of Windows upon exiting.
    This will be done in the next release.</li>
</ul>
<hr>


<h1>Amaya 2.1</h1>

<p>24 June, 1999</p>

<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User Interface:
    <ul>
      <li>The Save item in menu File and the Save button are disabled when the
        document does not need to be saved.</li>
      <li>Menu entries Quotation, Subscript, Superscript, and BDO can be set
        or unset from the "Character element" menu.</li>
      <li>New colorful button bar</li>
      <li>New Home button</li>
      <li>Command File/New has been changed. It now proposes 3 possibilities:
        <ol>
          <li>"New HTML document" displays a form to choose the location of
            the document to be created before it displays a blank page.</li>
          <li>"From template" proposes a list of templates to be used for the
            new document when you have a template server.</li>
          <li>"New CSS" displays a form to choose the style sheet location
            first.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Menu Special/Preferences contains a new item for language
        negotiation.</li>
      <li>In addition to the color palette in the Special/Preferences/Colors
        menu, the user may now type in directly the color code (the color
        palette is only available under Windows).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thot API: Due to a conflict with the libjpeg definition the Thot type
    boolean has been renamed ThotBool.</li>
  <li>MathML: the full presentation part of MathML is now supported, but not
    all attributes are yet taken into account when formatting mathematical
    expressions.</li>
  <li>LibWWW:
    <ul>
      <li>Updated to version 5.2.9.</li>
      <li>The libwww is now compiled as a number of mini libraries instead of
        big, monolithic one. We only compile those that are needed for Amaya,
        thus reducing the compilation time and size of the Amaya
      executable.</li>
      <li>The libwww cache entry wasn't being updated when saving a previously
        cached document.</li>
      <li>Tagged the libwww CVS base with an "Amaya" tag, showing the
        reference version currenly being used by the Amaya team.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New list of Amaya shortcuts for both Windows and Unix platforms.</li>
  <li>User preferences:
    <ul>
      <li>Changed the behavior of the user and temporary directories under
        Windows.</li>
      <li>Stopped using the Windows registry to store state information.</li>
      <li>The directory where the user preferences are stored is now a fixed
        one. The user may change the location of the temporary directory as
        well as that of the cache. Users are advised to reselect their
        preferences, rather copying their precedent thot.rc file. You may copy
        your amaya.css, HTML.conf, keyboard.kb, and dictionary.DCT files from
        your old Amaya home directory to its new location (open the
        Special/Preferences/General Preferences menu to find where it is). For
        more information, consult the Help/Configuring Amaya document.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Amaya was not able to use the shared library libjpeg.so.</li>
  <li>There were some memory leaks in the previous version.</li>
  <li>CSS parser:
    <ul>
      <li>CSS comments were lost in the style element.</li>
      <li>The end of the style element was not detected when it included an
        unclosed CSS comment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Amaya crashed when following a redirection to an invalid URL.</li>
  <li>Amaya could crash after a copy/paste of a mathematical formula from one
    page to another.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the paste command mixed pasted elements and the cursor
  jumped.</li>
  <li>It was impossible to set font-size to 20 in the preference menu.</li>
  <li>Amaya didn't take care to the Shift in the keyboard configuration
  file.</li>
  <li>Improvement of Windows dialogues.</li>
  <li>The libwww cache entry wasn't being updated when saving a previously
    cached document.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

    <ul>
      <li>link a CSS file using the standard Amaya paragdim: Click to select

  <li>After a "Make Book" the document is automatically switched to the
    Read-Only mode. This will avoid the user to edit it or save it by
  error.</li>
  <li>Publication thru the net now uses the HTTP/1.1 etags and conditional
    headers to avoid the lost updates problem..</li>
  <li>The 409 HTTP error message (conflict) is now shown in a popup
  window.</li>

  <li>First version of Preferences configuration menus.</li>
  <li>The Verfiy each PUT with a GET option is now turned off by default</li>
  <li>It's now possible to browse with a simple-click or a double-click. By
    default Amaya uses the double-click, but it could be switched to

        Unix dialogue API.</li>
      <li>New functions: TtaGiveNextElement, TtaGetFirstLeaf,
      TtaGetLastLeaf</li>
      <li>A new Thot event: TteElemClick</li>

  </li>
  <li>All user Amaya preferences and personal files are collected into a home
    directory. By default this directory is $HOME/.amaya on Unix platforms and
    C:\TEMP\amaya on Windows platforms. These files are:
    <ul>
      <li>a personal amaya.css</li>
      <li>a personal amaya.keyboard (amaya.kb on Windows)</li>
      <li>a personal dictionary</li>
      <li>thot.rc personal preferences. This file is generated and updated
        thru the Special/Preferences menu</li>
      <li>other temporary files and directories used by Amaya.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After a paste command, the selection is now set at the end of the pasted
    text where the user could continue to insert text.</li>
  <li>The Amaya CVS base is now available in read-only mode at
    http://dev.w3.org/ The Root directory is now Amaya instead of Thot and the
    libwww is no longer considered as a part of the Amaya code. The source tar
    file includes the libwww code (libwww is a directory next to Amaya) and
    one who acceedes the CVS base needs to get the libwww code (cvs get
    libwww) to compile Amaya.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Scripts can now be created within the document Body and are no longer
    moved into the Head at parsing time.</li>

    generated wrong coords values on Windows platforms.</li>
  <li>Comments in files amaya.keyboard and amaya.kb are now allowed.</li>
  <li>When a document included the sequence
    &lt;form>..&lt;table>..&lt;/form>..&lt;/table> Amaya closed the table at
    the end of the form. Now it reports a parsing error on the end tag
    &lt;/form> and avoids to split the table.</li>
  <li>Copying an image from a remote document to a local document didn't
  work.</li>
  <li>When following a link which had a "?foo" ending, Amaya treated that
    ending as a query string.</li>
  <li>Some attributes values appeared with strange names in the Attribute
    menu.</li>
  <li>When the current position was in a sequence of empty blocks (paragraphs,
    for instance), the Backspace key deleted two of these blocks at once and
    did not select anything.</li>
  <li>When pasting a paragraph with an attribute at the beginning of a table
    cell or list item, it was turned into a pseudo-paragraph, and produced
    wrong HTML code when the document was saved.</li>
  <li>Amaya locked up when one applied the strong command to a text displayed
    at the beginning of a line.</li>
  <li>CSS selectors like "PRE SPAN.test" didn't work.</li>
  <li>The CSS parser didn't parse well the rule url("...").</li>
  <li>SMALL elements could be displayed too small.</li>
  <li>&lt;basefont face="...."> was saved as &lt;basefont facee="....">.</li>
  <li>When putting an attribute on a text string, the attribute was generated
    as text in the HTML output. Now a SPAN element is generated to carry the
    attribute. This bug occured with attributes title, dir, and most event
    attributes (onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, etc.).</li>
  <li>Amaya crashed when loading an isolated image with a filename without a
    suffix.</li>
  <li>People who compiled Amaya on Windows platforms couldn't display jpeg
    images. The problem is fixed now.</li>
  <li>The authentication handlers were desactivated while doing a HEAD
    pre-check during the lost update PUT procedure.</li>
  <li>While browsing an image, pressing the reload button didn't show the
    image again.</li>
  <li>It wasn't possible to browse images when the request was redirected to a
    URL having a different end name.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Amaya 1.4 and 1.4a</h1>

<p>12 January 1999</p>

<h2>New Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Update of the German dialogue files (voluntary work done by Erich
    Koerting)</li>
  <li>On Unix platforms only, the variable DOUBLECLICKDELAY of the registry
    $HOME/.thotrc allows one to control the delay (in millisecond) under which
    two mouse clicks are classed as a double-click. The default value is
  500.</li>
  <li><p>OPTGROUP elements are accepted within SELECT elements. The
    corresponding cascade menus are built by Amaya and the right string is
    sent to the server when submitting a form that contains OPTGROUPs. An item
    in the Types/Form menu allows the user to create OPTGROUP elements or to
    wrap OPTION elements into an OPTGROUP element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Elements FIELDSET and LEGEND from HTML 4.0 are implemented.</li>
  <li>Event attributes like onmousedown, onmousemove, etc. are listed in a
    sub-menu of the Attributes menu (Events sub-menu).</li>
  <li>When creating a Table, Amaya asks the user about the number of rows and
    columns s/he wants. When a new cell is created, the corresponding column
    is generated at the same position.</li>
  <li>When target icons were introduced, it was no longer possible to click
    the target element (an element with an ID attribute or an anchor with a
    NAME) to set a link. This possibility is available now.</li>
  <li>When reloading a document, the fresh document is shown in the formatted
    window at the position the previous version was shown.</li>
  <li>When saving a document in XML, Amaya follows the Voyager guidelines
    (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml)</li>
  <li>When printing a document, you can decide whether the document URL is
    printed at the top of each page or not.</li>
  <li>A new field in the dialogue form used to insert images allows the user
    to enter an ALT attribute. This attribute is mandatory.</li>
  <li>libwww has been upgraded to version 5.2. This version of libwww supports
    HTTP/1.1, rev. 05</li>
  <li>A first implementation of the message digest authentication protocol, as
    defined in &lt;draft-ietf-http-authentication-03>. The code is
    interoperable with the current (which is an old) implementation of this
    protocol inside Apache/1.3.</li>
  <li>When Amaya detects errors in a loaded document, it generates a log file
    which can be displayed by the entry "Show log file" in the menu
  "Special".</li>
  <li>Thot compilers (str, prs, tra and app) are available on Windows
    platforms, so it's now possible to develop Amaya on these platforms.</li>
  <li>When an URI points at a single image, Amaya can display this image in a
    document window.</li>
  <li>Each Amaya window can be switched from Read-Only (Browser) to Read-Write
    (Editor) mode, and vice versa.</li>
  <li>A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed bugs:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There was a memory leak when following an internal link pointing to an
    inexistent anchor.</li>
  <li>Links which point to non-existent documents or invalid URLs are now left
    in the "active" state, instead of being set to the "visited" state.</li>
  <li>Browsing an image from an edited document (and thus requiring the
    opening of a new document window), didn't show the image.</li>
  <li>When one created a table while the current selection pointed to an empty
    paragraph, Amaya tried to replace the empty paragraph by the table, but
    there was a bug which corrupted the Amaya internal structure.</li>
  <li><p>In the menu associated with a &lt;SELECT multiple> element it's now
    possible to deselect selected OPTIONs</p>
  </li>
  <li>Table formatting: - Amaya wasn't able to find the correct cell width
    when the contents of this cell was centered or when a cell included
    complex structures. - When a table of a given width included constrained
    and unconstrained cells the result was sometimes incorrect. - When a table
    with vertical spans was resized, row heights were not updated.</li>
  <li>Amaya constrained the structure and reordered some elements in the HEAD:
    Meta, Script, Link, Style.</li>
  <li>Command Apply Class did not work always, especially when the current
    selection was crossing elements at different levels.</li>
  <li>Relative URIs for background images were always interpreted according to
    the document URI, even when it was relative to a stylesheet.</li>
  <li>A background image in no-repeat mode was sometimes repeated
  erroneously.</li>
  <li>Amaya tended to raise windows too often.</li>
  <li>Moving the cursor accross tables and BR elements didn't work
  correctly.</li>
  <li>When a character '&amp;' appeared in an ALT attribute (and in some other
    attributes), it was saved as is in the HTML file. It's now saved as
    '&amp;amp;'</li>
  <li>The use of autoconf has been improved to make the Amaya building easier
    (suggestions from Sam and Adam).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Amaya 1.3b</h1>

<p>October 14, 1998</p>

<h2>New Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Whenever there's an authentication failure, Amaya will ask the user if
    he wants to retry or abandon the operation.</li>
  <li><p>It's now possible to configure different network related timeouts
    thru the registry file</p>
  </li>
  <li>Amaya now uses the DEFLATE transfer encoding in the HTTP headers</li>
  <li>It's now possible to double-click within Windows selectors (Open
    Document, Spell-checker, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed bugs 1.3b:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Amaya generated line breaks into script and style elements. That has
    been fixed now.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the Backward and/or Forward buttons didn't work fine if you
    had successively loaded local and HTTP documents. Now it works.</li>
  <li>There was still a bug in vertical table formatting.</li>
  <li>While saving a remote document which was just edited, Amaya reported a
    failure of the operation, even if it was a success</li>
  <li>When Amaya save a document locally, the user can now give a relative
    path or the "~/xxx" path for images but the corresponding directory need
    to be created before.</li>
  <li>While browsing a protected site, Amaya could prompt the user many times
    for its password (bug inside the new libwww)</li>
  <li>When a paragraph was right aligned and updated, the current line could
    be not redisplayed correctly.</li>
  <li>When changing the type of an existing element (for instance changing a
    H2 into a Paragraph), the following elements (H2 elements in that case)
    were not renumbered correctly.</li>
  <li>The Windows version couldn't print the help page of Math.</li>
  <li>When MULTI_KEY is active the input method has been modified to support
    the ó character.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Amaya 1.3a</h1>

<p>September 25, 1998</p>

<h2>New Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Amaya tries to save modified documents when it crashes. Then, the next
    Amaya session proposes to reload theses documents when it starts.</li>
  <li>Target anchors are no longer displayed in green. All elements which can
    be used as a target for a link show a target icon. These icons are always
    visible in the "Links" view. In the "Formatted view", the user has to ask
    Amaya to show them. An entry "Show targets" in the "Views" menu
    alternatively shows or hides target icons in the "Formatted view". When
    the user wants to create a link to a specific element, s/he must click on
    the corresponding target icon.</li>
  <li>New version of the jpeg library (except for the Windows version).</li>
  <li>Amaya uses the latest version of libwww. This version provides Amaya
    with an up-to-date implementation of HTTP/1.1 including pipelining and
    caching</li>
  <li>Amaya can save documents in XML. Command Save As proposes 3 output
    formats: HTML, XML, Plain text. When a document is saved in XML, the usual
    HTML structure is used, but it is written in the XML language.</li>
  <li>Conversely, Amaya can read HTML documents written in XML. These
    documents can then be edited and saved in HTML, XML or plain text.</li>
  <li>When saving a document in XML, namespaces are used if the document
    contains XML elements such as mathematical expressions in MathML or 2D
    vector graphics.</li>
  <li>The following HTML 4.0 elements are available: NOSCRIPT, LABEL,
  BUTTON.</li>
  <li>Some support is provided for frames: the parser recognizes tags
    FRAMESET, FRAME, and NOFRAMES as well as their attributes and Amaya
    displays them as if they were links. You can double click them to fetch
    the corresponding page.</li>
  <li>The following HTML 4.0 attributes are available: onload, onunload,
    charset, hreflang, target, accesskey, tabindex, onfocus, onblur, media,
    longdesc, declare, archive, standby, valuetype, object, onsubmit, onreset,
    accept-charset, disabled, readonly, onselect, onchange, accept, label,
    char, charoff, summary, frame, rules, datapagesize, abbr, axis, headers,
    scope, profile, scheme, language, defer, event, for</li>
  <li>All HTML 4.0 character entities are accepted by the HTML parser and are
    generated when saving HTML files.</li>
  <li>You can create STYLE and SCRIPT elements with the Structure menu in the
    Structure_view.</li>
  <li>You can edit the content of elements STYLE and SCRIPT in the
    Structure_view.</li>
  <li>Characters that are not available on the keyboard can be entered by key
    sequences. For instance, e acute is entered by pressing key ' and then key
    e. This multi-key support is now available on Windows platforms. On Unix
    and Windows it is optional and needs to be requested by setting
    "ENABLE_MULTIKEY=YES" in the registry file ($HOME/.thotrc for Unix
    platforms or Amaya/config/thot.rc for Windows platforms).</li>
  <li>Amaya fixes nested lists generated by Mozilla: when a OL or UL is a
    child of another OL or UL, the former is considered by the Amaya parser as
    a child of its previous LI sibling. According to the HTML DTD, the only
    allowed children for a UL or OL are LIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed bugs 1.3a:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Improvement of the auto-scroll on dragging and availability on Windows
    version.</li>
  <li>Improvement of the printing of tables: when a table was split by a page
    break, the page header and the page footer were overlapped by some table
    elements.</li>
  <li>To be consistent with other editors, the management of the Backspace is
    modified. With a non-empty selection the Backspace deletes the current
    selection but not the previous character.</li>
  <li>Improvement of CSS parsing. Style commands (format, colors, etc.) are
    also improved.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it was impossible to copy/paste from Amaya to another
    application.</li>
  <li>Improvement of form handling:
    <ul>
      <li>Password fields in forms showed the text which is being typed
      in.</li>
      <li>Some special characters in the query string were not being correctly
        escaped.</li>
      <li>There was a limitation on the size of the query string.</li>
      <li>It wasn't possible to type a CR in the textarea zone</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When the user filled a form, Amaya considered that the document had been
    modified, as if one were in an edition mode, rather than in a browsing
  one</li>
  <li>The default color of ReadOnly documents is now black.</li>
  <li>Bullets in UL elements didn't grow with the UL size.</li>
  <li>When saving a document, the document status was set unmodified even if
    the operation failed. "Save As" could change attributes URL and SRC. If
    the saving failed old values were lost. Now Amaya restores the previous
    document state.</li>
  <li>Improvement of the vertical table formatting.</li>
  <li>Broken connection pipes weren't taken into account under AIX</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known bugs:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>By integrating the newest libwww, we got a very good implementation of
    HTTP/1.1. However, this version of the library can be fragile when
    contacting badly implemented HTTP/1.0 servers. For example, servers that
    don't send the correct headers or which don't understand the 1.1 protocol
    version in the request.</li>
  <li>Pushing the stop button in any document window closes all the open
    connections in all the document windows.</li>
  <li>Entities in URLs should be converted before being sent to the
  server.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Amaya 1.3</h1>

<p>July 10, 1998</p>

<h2>New Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Print on Windows is now available.</li>
  <li>"Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" functions are now available.</li>
  <li>Amaya uses the standard clipboard. On Windows versions Copy/Paste takes
    the standard clipboard into account. On Unix versions, Copy form clip
    board and Paste form Clipboard are attached to the usual mouse buttons
    (Left and Middle). Consequently, selection extension is now performed by
    the Shift + Left button of the mouse.</li>
  <li>The drag now generates an auto-scroll (not available on Windows).</li>
  <li>There is a new input method for Iso-Latin-1 characters. According to the
    following table one can obtain a 'ã' by first pressing '~' then typing
    'a'. To obtain a simple '~' you have to press '~' twice.

<h1>New features in Amaya 1.1</h1>

<p>July 10 and September 15, 1997</p>

<h2>Extensions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Anchors and ID attributes:
    <ul>
      <li>When Amaya parses a document it checks that all MAPs have a
        different NAME, and it changes duplicate NAMEs. The USEMAP attribute
        of the related IMG element is updated accordingly.</li>
      <li>The function "Create Target" generates an attribute NAME or ID
        depending on the current selection. - If the DTD allows the insertion
        of an anchor as the parent of the current selection, Amaya creats an
        anchor and takes the first included word of more than 3 characters as
        the value of the NAME attribute. - If a single structured element is
        selected (DIV, H1, etc.), Amaya generates an ID attribute for this
        structured element. The ID value is generated, like the NAME value,
        after the included text. Amaya checks that the new NAME or ID value is
        unique. If it's not the case it changes the value by adding a number
        at the end of the word. For example, it generates "value1" if "value"
        already exists in the document.</li>
      <li>When an anchor with a NAME attribute or an element with an ID
        attribute is pasted, Amaya checks that the new NAME or ID value is
        unique and changes it if it's not unique.</li>
      <li>Functions which create a MAP element generates automatically a NAME
        with value "map". Amaya checks that the new NAME value is unique.</li>
      <li>When an IMG with a USEMAP attribute is pasted, Amaya remove this
        attribute, and when an IMG with a USEMAP attribute is deleted, it does
        take care of the related MAP element. The document author is supposed
        to delete this MAP or to link it to another IMG element.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Links:
    <p>The functions "Create Link" and "Change Link" create an anchor if the
    DTD allows the insertion of an anchor as the parent of the current
    selection. Then the user can click a target anchor or a target document or
    a structured element with an ID attribute. - If it's not a valid target,
    Amaya displays a form to insert the HREF value. - If the user clicks on a
    valid target, Amaya generates automatically the HREF value. In both cases,
    Amaya transforms the HREF value to make it relative to the document base
    (the BASE element value or the current document URL).</p>
    <p>When an anchor with a HREF attribute is pasted, Amaya transforms the
    HREF value to make it relative to the document base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Images:
    <p>The function "Create Image" creates the SRC value relatively to the
    document base (the BASE element value or the current document URL). Amaya
    also creates the ALT attribute and initializes its value with the image
    name.</p>
    <p>When an IMG is pasted, Amaya transforms the SRC value to make it
    relative to the document base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Publishing:
    <ul>
      <li><p>Button "Copy Images" indicates that images have to be copied
        into: - the new document directory (on the remote server or locally),
        - the new image directory, if there is a specified image
        directory.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Button "Transform URLs" indicates that all URLs and SRCs are
        recomputed when saving the document. In both cases, Amaya generates
        relative URLs when it's possible.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Customization: Each user can define his/her personal file HTML.conf in
    his/her HOME directory. So each individual user can now customize size and
    position of Amaya windows.</li>
  <li>Java: Upgraded to Kaffe-0.9.1 using the JDK 1.1.2 classes. The mechanism
    to access Java objects content has been cleaned up and should be ready for
    64 bit targets. Java stubs are not distributed anymore, the Makefiles
    produced by autoconf build them on the fly to avoid conflict in case of
    changes in the HTML schemas. General improvements for the Java classes
    embedding access to the document C objects.</li>
  <li>Math: This version of Amaya contains an embryonic MathML editor, that
    allows mathematical expressions to be embedded in HTML pages. It
    implements a subset of the MathML specification. This feature should be
    considered as a demonstration, as it is very incomplete. More in next
    releases.</li>
  <li>MS/Windows This is the first version of Amaya that runs on Microsoft
    Windows (both Windows 95 and Windows/NT).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p>Spaces were not accepted in end tags. For instance, <code>&lt;/STRONG
    ></code> was considered invalid. It is accepted now.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Amaya refused to create an Image before an Image. Now it works.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Sometimes, active zones were not created.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using Style forms, the text was displayed correctly, but the style
    attribute registered the previous style value instead of the new one.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li><p>Two new views are available (see the Views menu):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Links view shows and allows to edit all links in the
        document.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Table of Contents displays and allows to edit all (and only)
        headings (Hn).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like the Alternate and Structure view, these new views are
    "synchronised" with the other views of the document. These views can be
    printed with the document (see the Setup and Print command)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The Help button loads the Amaya documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>New menu "Special" with the following commands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Transform (was the last item of the Types menu): structure
        transformations</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Section Numbering: numbers headings (Hn) in the main view and in
        the table of contents. Numbers are automatically updated when headers
        are inserted or deleted. Section numbers are not saved with the
        document, but they are printed if numbering is active when the Print
        command is issued.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Make Book: allows to merge several HTML documents into a single one
        (for printing a collection, for instance). This is based on typed
        links (rel="chapter").</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Printing has been extended:
    <ul>
      <li>"Setup and Print": this command proposes to change print options
        before printing. Parameters ManualFeed, Table of contents, Numbered
        links and default PostScript file name are reset when a new document
        is printed. New options are:
        <ul>
          <li>Table of contents: prints the Table_of_contents view of the
            document.</li>
          <li>Numbered links: numbers links in the main view and prints
          them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>"Print": this command prints the document with the print parameters
        defined in previous "Setup and Print" command.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Directories are no longer automatically browsed when the user inserts
    them in the "Open Location" form. A new button (List) is added in this
    form that allows to explicitly browse the current directory.</li>
  <li>It's now possible to extend dictionaries used by the spell-checker. When
    the user clicks on a (+dic) button in the spell-checker form, the current
    word is added to the common extensible dictionary. By default this common
    dictionary is located in $HOME/.thot.DIC, but the user can change this
    location in the .thotrc registry: EXTENDDICT=</li>
  <li>Documents can be saved in text form (see Save As command), with a list
    of URLS for external links.</li>
  <li>Images are zoomed according to attributes width and height. Combining
    the Control key with the Middle button of the mouse allows the user to
    easily resize an image.</li>
  <li>CSS: More properties are supported: background-color, background-image,
    background-repeat, text-align.</li>
  <li>The registry now supports $(MACHINE) for architecture dependent
  paths.</li>
  <li>Java support: Amaya now integrates the Java Kaffe runtime. This version
    uses the Jigsaw HTTP/1.1 classes to do network access, and provide a user
    cache. Most of the Thot API is available from the Java language offering
    an easy customization path for Amaya users. This also simplifies
    significantly the use of Amaya as a testbed since a lot of developements
    are done in Java and can easily be integrated to the existing base.</li>
  <li>HTML markup is now in lowercase, to improve efficiency of compression
    tools.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2>Fixed bug</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When saving a document in HTML, Amaya omitted quotes around some
    attribute values.</li>
  <li>When inserting an anchor around a sample image, the image was sometimes
    lost.</li>
  <li>On 1 bit per pixel screens, buttons in dialog boxes were entirely black
    and selection was invisible.</li>
  <li>Amaya didn't select any element or character when the mouse was out of
    document limits.</li>
  <li>Some improvements to table formatting (cells containing a single IMG
    with a width attribute are formatted correctly).</li>
  <li>Creation of new definitions (DD) at the beginning of a definition list
    (DL) is now possible.</li>
  <li>Amaya tried to interpret "&amp;" followed by a non-letter as an entity.
    It's now interpreted as ordinary text.</li>
  <li>When a &lt;TD> tag follows a &lt;TABLE> tag without a &lt;TR> in
    between, a WIDTH attribute associated with &lt;TD> was considered
  invalid.</li>
  <li>Amaya created additional &lt;P> tags in table cells and list items.</li>
  <li>tags such as &lt;B>, &lt;I>, &lt;EM>, etc. caused troubles in &lt;PRE>
    elements.</li>
</ul>

<h1>New features in Amaya 0.9</h1>

<p><em>November 14, 1996</em></p>

<h2>Extensions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Structure transformation (command Types/Transform)
    <ul>
      <li>more efficient pattern matching algorithm</li>
      <li>more structure checking: transformations are not proposed to the
        user if they lead to an invalid structure (even if the transformation
        is matched with the selection).</li>
      <li>the last modification time of the file <code>HTML.trans</code> is
        checked before it is parsed.</li>
      <li>in version 0.8, if the parser detects an error in file
        <code>HTML.trans</code>, the transformation process is stopped. Now,
        the parser skips the invalid transformation.</li>
      <li>error messages are displayed at the bottom of the window.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Color palette
    <ul>
      <li>The palette highlights the foreground and background colors of the
        element selected when the palette is opened. The highlight allows
        users to choose the same colors for different elements.</li>
      <li>It is also possible now to remove a color attribute from an element
        just using the "standard color" button in the palette.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Forms
    <ul>
      <li>forms can now be sent using GET and POST methods to
        protected/unprotected URLs</li>
      <li>creation of form components has been improved</li>

    <ul>
      <li>the latest extensions of HTML 3.2. have been added: tag BASEFONT and
        attributes width and height for tags TH and TD.</li>
      <li>It is now possible to add comments in HTML documents (use command
        Structure/Comment in the Structure view)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>User Interface
    <ul>
      <li>When the current selection is within a PRE element, some menu
        entries are disabled: Image in Types menu, and Big, Small, Sub, Sup,
        and Font in Character Element menu.</li>
      <li>Interpretation of "~" and "file:" in "Open" and "Save As" dialogue
        boxes</li>
      <li>In previous versions, I B and TT buttons were never updated when
        selection changed. Now they are displayed according to the current
        selection.</li>
      <li>Continuous scroll: the document scrolls as you move the slider</li>
      <li>Distinction between "Cancel" and "Done" buttons in dialogue
      boxes.</li>
      <li>When opening the Structure view, the document is displayed with the
        selected part visible in that view.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Environment variables are initialized from the Registry (file
    <code>thot.ini</code>)</li>
  <li>Integration of libwww5.0a, giving among other things: HTTP/1.1 and
    keep-alive connections.</li>
  <li>Reload button and command (File/Reload Document).</li>
  <li>Spell checker is now available for English and French, but both
    dictionaries are far from complete.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Closing an Amaya window with a window manager command caused Amaya to
    crash. Now only the concerned window is closed.</li>
  <li>The HTML parser inserted a space at the beginning of a new line
    generated by a &lt;BR> tag followed by new line in the source file.</li>
  <li>Call "Change link" from Links menu and click in the document itself. The
    dialog box for entering the URL of the target was empty in previous
    versions. Now it contains the current value of attribute HREF.</li>
  <li>Select some characters, call "Create link" from Link menu and click in
    the document itself. Do not enter anything in the dialogue box for the URL
    and press the Cancel button in this dialogue box. Later, call the Change
    link command for entering an actual URL for that anchor. Nothing happened
    in previous versions. Now you can change the URL.</li>
  <li>Some elements were lost during structure transformation, this is now
    fixed.</li>
  <li>Structure transformation was impossible if the selection contains
    comments or invalid elements. Now transformations are possible (invalid
    tags are removed in the new structure).</li>
  <li>In previous versions, if the input focus is in one window and you press
    the H1 button (or any other button of that kind) in another window (with a
    different document in it) it changes the first window. Now, the button
    does nothing.</li>
  <li>Colors management is completely re-casted and we hope to solve color
    problems in previous versions.</li>
  <li>An emphasized string (or strong or...) can now span several lines in a
    Preformatted.</li>
  <li>When the same Web image is shared by two loaded documents, just one
    local copy was created by Amaya and this copy was lost when the first
    document was closed. This choice causes troubles when user tried to
    publish the second document. Now Amaya creates two copies, one for each
    document.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste on images didn't work fine in previous release.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, local copies of remote documents were not created in the
    right place. Now it works.</li>
  <li>When user closed a document view with the Window Manager, the whole
    application exited. Now only the document view is closed.</li>
  <li>It is now possible to save a document if it is modified and close
  it.</li>
  <li>In the previous version, Amaya did not detect the cancel of the network
    save of an object to a protected URL space.</li>
  <li>Inserting an image from a local directory did not react well to errors.
    This has been corrected.</li>
  <li>Call "Create Link" when an target anchor is selected or "Create Target"
    when a link anchor is selected, Amaya refused to add the href or name
    attribute. Now it works.</li>
  <li>Call "Change Link" anywhere asked to select the destination. Now this
    function works only within an link anchor.</li>
  <li>After loading a lot of CSS files Amaya cannot load images because file
    descriptors are not freed. Now it is correct.</li>
  <li>The command "Save As" doesn't work or crashes. Now it is correct.</li>
  <li>Bug in area-mapping (circle) fixed.</li>
  <li>Support of the starting option -display</li>
  <li>If a user gave a wrong password, Amaya did not ask the user for the new
    password. It kept using the wrong one. Fixed.</li>
  <li>When typing in the WYSIWYG window, clicking e.g. the "Italics" button
    enters italics mode. After typing a few italic chars one wants to change
    back to normal mode. Clicking the "Italics" button once again achieves
    this. But you can't go on typing in normal mode, because this second click
    also selects the italic text to become the active (highlighted) region.
    Simply typing ahead overwrites the whole (italic) region. This bug is
    fixed.</li>
  <li>The implicit break following the &lt;HR>failed to appear when a
    &lt;FONT><font> tag follows &lt;BR>. The text within the FONT construct
    appeared to the right ofthe horizontal rule. This bug is fixed</font></li>
  <li><font>When typing in the WYSIWYG window, clicking e.g. the "Italics"
    button enters italics mode. After typing a few italic chars one wants to
    change back to normal mode. Clicking the "Italics" button once again
    achieves this. But you can't go on typing in normal mode, because this
    second click also selects the italic text to become the active
    (highlighted) region. Simply typing ahead overwrites the whole (italic)
    region. This bug is fixed.</font></li>
  <li><font>Printing with "US" paper size did not work. Bug fixed.</font></li>
  <li><font>When changing attribut "align" for an element DIV containing
    paragraphs, the paragraphs were not redisplayed with the alignment defined
    by the attribute but they moved in a weird way in the Structure view. This
    bug is fixed.</font></li>
  <li>Select a DT and change its style: the DT element in the Structure view
    gets confused. Bug fixed.</li>
  <li>Selection was moved to its original position at the ned of command
    Edit/Find. It now stays at its current position.</li>
