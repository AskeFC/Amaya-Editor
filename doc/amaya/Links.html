<h3><a name="L557">Creating a target anchor</a></h3>

<p>
A target anchor is a piece of text that is referred to by a link (a source
anchor). Before creating a link to such a piece of text, you must first turn
it into a target anchor.</p>
<p>
Just select a character string with the mouse and choose <strong>Create
Target</strong> from the <strong>Links</strong> menu. The selected text is now
<a href="Browsing.html#L515">displayed in
green</a>, which identifies it as a target anchor.</p>
<h3><a name="L245">Creating a link</a></h3>

<h4>External links</h4>

<p>
To create an anchor that is a link to another document:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="Selecting.html#L65">Select</a> the extent
of the anchor to be created 
<li>
Click the <img src="Link.gif" align=middle>
 button or choose <strong>Create Link</strong> from the <strong>Links</strong>
menu 
<li>
If the target document is displayed by <strong>Amaya</strong>, just click
anywhere on it. The link is created. 
<p>
If the target document is not displayed</p>
<ul>
<li>
click anywhere in the current document, except on a green anchor 
<li>
a dialog box pops up: enter the URL of the target document and click on the
<strong>Confirm</strong> button. The link is created. 
</ul>
</ol>
<h4>Internal links</h4>

<p>
To create a link to a particular anchor in the same document or in another,
replace step 3 above by:</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">
click in any view on the <a
href="#L557">target anchor</a>,
which should be displayed in green in the Formatted view. The link is created.

</ol>
<h3>Removing a link or a target anchor</h3>

<p>
The <strong>Links</strong> menu contains a command that reverses the two
commands above: <strong>Delete Anchor</strong>. Put the selection or the
insertion point anywhere within the anchor to be removed (you do not need to
select the whole anchor, but you can) and activate the <strong>Delete
Anchor</strong> command. The anchor is removed, but its content remains.</p>
<h3>Changing a link</h3>

<p>
If you want to keep an anchor but to change the target of the corresponding
link, select any part of that anchor or just put the insertion point within
the anchor, and choose <strong>Change Link</strong> from the
<strong>Links</strong> menu. Then designate the new target of the anchor as
above (step 3 in the <a
href="#L245">creation of a
link</a>).</p>
<p>
To change the target of a link, you can also edit the <code>href</code>
attribute, either directly in the Structure view or in the Links view or using
the <a
href="Attributes.html#L603"><strong>Attributes</strong>
menu</a>.</p>
