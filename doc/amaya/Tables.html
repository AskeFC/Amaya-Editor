<h2><a name="L949">Editing tables</a></h2>

<p>
There is no separate table editor in <strong>Amaya</strong>. A table is simply
a structure described by the HTML DTD and it is edited as such. The same
commands apply to tables as to other HTML structures.</p>
<p>
Tables can be created very efficiently with the <a
href="/tahiti/vatton/opera/doc/amaya/Manual.html#L906">Return key</a>. Create
a one-cell table with the table button or the <strong>Table</strong> entry
from the <strong>Types</strong> menu. The insertion point is then moved to the
caption of that table. Enter the caption and/or move to the first cell. Type
in the content of that cell. Create a second cell by hitting the Return key
twice (the first hit creates a paragraph in the first cell). To create a new
row, press Return three times. To create a new tbody, press Return four times,
etc.</p>
<p>
Note that the table model implemented in <strong>Amaya</strong>, while being
fully compatible with that defined in <a
href="/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Wilbur/">HTML&nbsp;3.2</a>, is extended to implement the
W3C Working Draft <a href="/pub/WWW/TR/WD-tables">The HTML3 Table Model</a>,
which has been accepted by the IETF as a proposed standard,<a
href="ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1942.txt"> RFC1942</a>.  This includes
features such as multiple bodies (<code>tbody</code>), header
(<code>thead</code>) and footer (<code>tfoot</code>).</p>
