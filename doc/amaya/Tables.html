<h2>Editing tables</h2>

<p>There is no separate table editor in <strong>Amaya</strong>. A table is
simply a structure described by the HTML DTD and it is edited as such. The
same commands apply to tables as to other HTML structures, with a few
additional ones.</p>

<h3>Creating a new table</h3>
</div>

<p>When activating the table button <img src="../Icons/table.gif" alt="Table
button"> or selecting the <strong>Table</strong> entry from the
<strong>Types</strong> menu, Amaya displays a dialog box which allows you to
specify the intial number of rows and columns for the new table, as well as
its border. If you have done that by mistake, just click the
<strong>Cancel</strong> button. To create a new table at the current position,
click the <strong>Confirm</strong> button. Amaya will then generate something
like the following table (3 columns and 2 rows in that case):</p>

<table border="1">
<caption>I</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The space above the table is reserved for the caption. The caret is
automatically put in this caption, so that you can enter its contents
immediately.  You can also delete it if you don' need a caption.</p>

<p>The new table contains empty cells. You can click on any of them and insert
text, images, and so on. You can also move the caret from cell to cell with
the arrow keys.</p>

<h3>Adding a new column</h3>

<div id="Editing1">

<p>New columns can be created very efficiently with the <a
href="Creating.html#L906">Return key</a>.  Move the insertion point to the end
or the beginning of a cell (for example at the end of Cell 1.1 in the table
below).  By hitting the Return key twice (the first hit creates a paragraph in
the current cell) you create a new cell and its corresponding column, as shown
below:</p>

<table border="1">
<caption>Caption</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Cell 1.1
</td>
<td>
I
</td>
<td>
Cell 1.2
</td>
<td>
Cell 1.3
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Cell 2.1
</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Adding a new row, a new tbody</h3>

<p>To create a new row, press Return three times when the insertion point is
at the end of the last cell in a row (in Cell 1.3, for instance).  You can
also select the row by <a href="Selecting.html#L894">hitting the ESC</a> key
and pressing Return only once.</p>

<p>To create a new <code>tbody</code>, press Return four times (or three times
if the cell is empty) and one time more to create a new paragraph after the
table.</p>
</div>

<h3>Removing a column</h3>

<div id="Editing11">

<p>There is no specific command to create a new column. When you create a new
cell, Amaya generates the corresponding new column. When you delete a cell in
a column that becomes empty, Amaya deletes the column automatically. But there
is a specific command (Delete table column) to delete a column, even if it's
not empty. This command is located at the end of submenu
<strong>Table</strong> of menu <strong>Types</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Adding something after a table</h3>

<p>Many element types can be included within table cells. For that reason,
Amaya could misunderstand what one wants to do when he selects an element type
(he clicks a button H1, H2, etc. or he selects an entry in the menu Type)
while a table component is selected. When one wants to create an element after
the table, he has to select the whole table (check the current selection in
the bottom line of the window) and hits the Return key. Amaya will generate a
paragraph after the table. This new paragraph can be transformed if
needed.</p>

<div id="Editing111">

<p><em>Note that the table model implemented in
</em><strong><em>Amaya</em></strong><em> is the </em><a
href="../../TR/REC-html40"><em>HTML&nbsp;4.0</em></a><em> model. This includes
features such as multiple bodies (</em><code><em>tbody</em></code><em>),
header (</em><code><em>thead</em></code><em>) and footer
(</em><code><em>tfoot</em></code><em>).</em></p>
