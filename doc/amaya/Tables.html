<h2>Editing tables</h2>
<p>
There is no separate table editor in <strong>Amaya</strong>. A table is simply
a structure described by the HTML DTD and it is edited as such. The same
commands apply to tables as to other HTML structures.</p>

<h3>Creating a new table</h3>
</div>
<p>
When the selection is empty and the user actives the table button  or selects
the <strong>Table</strong> entry from the <strong>Types</strong> menu, Amaya
display a form which allows the user to give the intial number of rows and
columns of the new created table and its border value. if the user
<strong>Cancel</strong> this form, the table is not created, otherwise the new
table is created according to the user's choice. As an example, consider the
following created table (3 columns and 2 rows):</p>

<table border="1">
<caption>I</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
The space above the table is reserved for the caption. This caption is
automatically selected after the creation and can be immediately deleted if
the user wants to create a table without caption.</p>
<p>
Amaya have had automatically generated empty cells. You can click on any of
them and insert text, images, etc. you can also move the insert point from
cell to cell by using arrow keys.</p>

<h3>Adding a new column</h3>

<div id="Editing1">
<p>
New columns can be created very efficiently with the <a
href="Creating.html#L906">Return key</a>.  Move the insertion point to the end
of the beginning of a cell (for example at the end of the Cell 1.1).  By
hitting the Return key twice (the first hit creates a paragraph in the first
cell) you create a new cell and its corresponding column.</p>

<table border="1">
<caption>Caption</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Cell 1.1
</td>
<td>
I
</td>
<td>
Cell 1.2
</td>
<td>
Cell 1.3
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Cell 2.1
</td>
<td></td>
<td>

</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Adding a new row, new tbody</h3>
<p>
To create a new row, press Return three times when the end of the Cell 1.3 is
selected.  If  you want to process more quickly, you can select the row by
hitting the ESC key and press Return.</p>
<p>
To create a new <code>tbody</code>, press Return four times (or three times if
the cell is empty) and one times more to create a new paragraph after the
table.</p>
</div>

<h3>Removing a column</h3>

<div id="Editing11">
<p>
There is no specific command to create a new column. When you create a new
cell, Amaya generates a new column. When you delete a cell within a column
that becomes empty, Amaya deletes the column automatically. But there is a
specific command to delete a column. This command is located in the submenu
<strong>Table</strong> of the menu <strong>Types</strong>.</p>
<p>
Note that the table model implemented in <strong>Amaya</strong> is the <a
href="../../TR/REC-html40">HTML&nbsp;4.0</a> model. This includes features
such as multiple bodies (<code>tbody</code>), header (<code>thead</code>) and
footer (<code>tfoot</code>).</p>
