<h2>Browsing versus Editing</h2>

<p><strong>Amaya</strong> is mainly an editor with browsing capabilities. When
used as a browser, it behaves like many other Web browsers, except for <a
href="#L311">activating links</a>. In normal operation <strong>Amaya</strong>
allows you to browse and edit documents simultaneously, but you can change
this standard behavior for each document window independently. The <img
src="../Icons/Editor.gif" alt="editor-mode"> button shows up that the window
is in editor mode: you can edit the current document and browse in this
window. By clicking on that button, you switch the window to browser mode. The
button is then displayed as <img src="../Icons/Browser.gif"
alt="browser-mode"> and you can only browse and fill in forms.</p>

<h3><a name="L311">Activating a link</a></h3>

<p>Links are usually displayed in blue (or underlined on monochrome displays).
As <strong>Amaya</strong> is an editor, by default a single click just moves
the insertion point. Thus, to activate a link, you must <em>double click</em>
on it. This behavior can be changed as well as many other parameters using a
preferences menu. By changing the "Double click activates link", you can
browse documents with a simple-click. In that case, you cannot easily put the
insert point within anchors:  you have to use the drag and/or arrows to move
the insert point within an anchor.</p>

<p>The document retrieved by this operation normally <em>replaces</em> the
current document in the same window, in the same mode (editor or browser ).
However, if the current document has been modified and has not been saved yet,
another window is created for the new document, to avoid losing last
changes.</p>

<h3><a name="L515">Target anchors</a></h3>

<p>Some pieces of text can be displayed with a <a name="target">target icon
<img src="../Icons/target.gif" alt=" target "></a>. These icons are not part
of the document and can be displayed or hidden just by controlling the "Show
targets" status of the current window. Entry "Show targets" of menu "Views"
allows you to control that status, window by window.</p>

<p>These icons are associated to <em>target elements</em>, i.e. elements with
an <code>ID</code> attribute, or <em>target anchors</em>, i.e. anchors with a
<code>name</code> attribute. They identify possible targets for links. These
icons are intended to make the creation of links easier. As you can quickly
recognize the possible target of a link, you can <a
href="Links.html#L245">create links</a> faster.</p>

<h3>Opening documents</h3>

<p>You can open local or remote documents in several different ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>File menu</dt>
<dd>
Two entries from the File menu, <strong>Open Document</strong> and
<strong>Open in New Window</strong>, allow you to open a new document in the
same window or in a new window respectively. Both commands bring up a dialog
box where you can enter either a local file name or an URI. The dialog box
also contains a file browser that helps you to locate local files.

<p>When the document is correctly specified, click on the
<strong>Confirm</strong> button.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"Address" area</dt>
<dd>
This area displays the file name or the URI of the current document. You can
edit it to specify a different (local or remote) document to be displayed in
the same window. Press the Enter key when the curso is in this area to
actually load the document.
</dd>
<dt>Following links</dt>
<dd>
<a href="#L311">Activating a link</a> to get the corresponding document.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Moving backward and forward</h3>

<p>Two buttons: <img alt="Back " border="0" src="../Icons/Back.gif"
align="middle"> and <img alt="Forward " border="0" src="../Icons/Forward.gif"
align="middle"> allow you to go back to the previous page or forward to the
next one.</p>
