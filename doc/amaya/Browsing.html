<h2>Browsing versus Editing</h2>

<p><strong>Amaya</strong> is mainly an editor with browsing capabilities.
When used as a browser, it behaves like many other Web browsers, except for
<a href="#Activating">activating links</a>. In normal operation
<strong>Amaya</strong> allows you to browse and edit documents
simultaneously, but you can change this standard behavior for each document
window independently. The <img src="../Icons/Editor.gif" alt="editor-mode" />
button shows up that the window is in editor mode: you can edit the current
document and browse in this window. By clicking on that button, you switch
the window to browser mode. The button is then displayed as <img
src="../Icons/Browser.gif" alt="browser-mode" /> and you can only browse and
fill in forms. This option is also available from the Edit menu option
<strong>Editor Mode</strong>, and as a keyboard shortcut (the default is
<strong>Shift-Control-*</strong>).</p>

<p>HTML documents are read by default as ISO-latin-1 files. Without any
information about the charset in the HTTP header or in a META element, a HTML
document is considered as encoded in ISO-latin-1. XHTML documents are read by
default as UTF 8 files. When there is no information about the charset in the
HTTP header, in the XML declaration, or in a META element, a XHTML document
is considered as encoded in UTF 8. As the default charset is different for
HTML documents and XHTML documents, it often occurs that authors created
ISO-latin-1 XHTML documents which don't provide information about the
charset. As soon as a character analyzed by the XML parser doesn't match a
valid UTF 8 character (it should occur if the document is encoded in
ISO-latin-1 but parsed as an UTF 8 file), the document is considered as
invalid: the parsing is stopped and an error message is displayed. In that
specific case, the command "<strong>Reopen in ISO-latin-1</strong>" is
activated. That command allows you to reopen the document with a charset set
to ISO-latin-1. The reopen document is now considered as modified (a charset
has been added) and can be saved.</p>

<p>Amaya interprets character entities.: When it's not able to interpret it,
it displays a '?' (or it displays the entity value when the entity is within
an attribute value or when the entityi s unknown). In all cases entities are
restored when the document is saved, except if the document encoding is
ISO-latin-1 and the entity corresponds to an ISO-latin-1 character. If the
document encoding is ASCII, Amaya translates ISO-latin-1 characters into
entities.</p>

<h3><a name="Activating">Activating a link</a></h3>

<p>Links are usually displayed in blue (or underlined on monochrome
displays). As <strong>Amaya</strong> is an editor, you must double click on a
link to activate it. A single click just moves the insertion point and
displays the expanded URI of the link into the status bar of the main
view.</p>

<p>This behavior can be changed as well as many other parameters using a
preferences menu. By changing the "Double click activates link", you can
browse documents with a simple-click. In that case, you cannot easily put the
insert point within anchors: you have to use the drag and/or arrows to move
the insert point within an anchor. It is also possible to use the keyboard to
activate links, as well as form controls. The default keyboard command is
<strong>Alt-Enter</strong> but the command <em>DoAction</em> can be mapped to
a different <a href="ShortCuts.html">shortcut</a>. The command
<em>NextLinkOrFormElement</em>, mapped by default to the shortcut
<strong>Tab</strong>, allows you to find the next (or the first) link or HTML
form element in the document. The command <em>PreviousLinkOrFormElement</em>,
mapped by default to the shortcut <strong>Shift-Tab</strong>, allows you to
find the previous (or the last) link or HTML form element in the document.</p>

<p>The document retrieved by this operation <em>replaces</em> the current
document in the same window, in the same mode (editor or browser). If the
current document has been modified and has not been saved yet, Amaya pops up
a dialogue box that asks if you accept to lose modifications.</p>

<p>A simple clic or a double clic with the right button of the mouse (it
works also with the middle button on Windows platforms) <em>opens</em> the
target document into a new window.</p>

<h3><a name="Access">Access keys</a></h3>

<p>An author could associate an attribute <code>accesskey</code> to a form
field, an area, or a link. The following elements support the accesskey:
AREA, BUTTON, INPUT, LABEL, LEGEND, and TEXTAREA.This can be crucial to
people with motoric disabilities but there are other conditions where it
could be necessary or useful.</p>

<p>When the author associated an attribute accesskey to a link in a document
(example <code>accesskey="n" or accesskey="N"</code>), the command
<strong>Alt-accesskey</strong> (in the example Alt-a) will activate that
link. Pressing <strong>Alt- accesskey</strong> when assigned to a form
element will give the focus to that element (the following element for LABEL
and LEGEND).</p>

<p>Access keys overwrite Amaya shortcuts. For example Help pages declare
access keys: "n" for going to the next page, "p" for going to the previous
page and "t" for the table of contents. If the user has assigned a shortcut
Alt-p to an Amaya command, this shortcut won't be accessible when these help
pages are displayed. By default the modifier key used for access keys is
<strong>Alt</strong>. The preferences menu
<code>Special/Preferences/General</code> lets one changes this default
configuration. The user can use the key <strong>Control</strong> instead of
<strong>Alt</strong> or can decide to disable the access keys handler.</p>

<h3><a name="L515">Target anchors</a></h3>

<p>Some pieces of text can be displayed with a <a name="target">target icon
<img src="../Icons/target.gif" alt=" target " /></a>. These icons are not
part of the document and can be displayed or hidden just by controlling the
<strong>Show targets</strong> status of the current window, which is an
option in the <strong>Views</strong> menu. The default keyboard command is
<strong>Control-v Control-t</strong> in Unix, <strong>Alt-v Alt-l</strong> in
Windows.</p>

<p>These icons are associated to <em>target elements</em>, i.e. elements with
an <code>ID</code> attribute, or <em>target anchors</em>, i.e. anchors with a
<code>name</code> attribute. They identify possible targets for links. These
icons are intended to make the creation of links easier. As you can quickly
recognize the possible target of a link, you can <a
href="Links.html#L245">create links</a> faster.</p>

<h3><a name="Opening">Opening documents</a></h3>

<p>You can open local or remote documents in several different ways:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>File menu</dt>
    <dd>Two entries from the File menu, <strong>Open Document</strong> and
      <strong>Open in New Window</strong>, allow you to open a new document
      in the same window or in a new window respectively. The default
      keyboard commands are respectively <strong>Control-x Contol-f</strong>
      and <strong>Control-x Control-o</strong> in Unix,
      <strong>Control-o</strong> and <strong>Shift-Control-O</strong> in
      Windows. Both commands bring up a dialog box where you can enter either
      a local file name or an URI. You can also select a file from the
      <strong>Browse</strong> option that contains a file browser and helps
      you to locate local files. 
      <p>When the document is correctly specified, click on the
      <strong>Confirm</strong> button. This command could be also used to
      create a new local document.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Command line "Open"</dt>
    <dd>This area displays the file name or the URI of the current document.
      You can edit it to specify a different (local or remote) document to be
      displayed in the same window. Press the Enter key when the cursor is in
      this area to actually load the document. This command could be also
      used to create a new local document.</dd>
  <dt>Following links</dt>
    <dd><a href="#L311">Activating a link</a> to get the corresponding
      document.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="Moving">Moving backward and forward</a></h3>

<p>There are several ways to move backward or forward through the history
list:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>File menu</dt>
    <dd>There are entries in the file menu for Forward and Backward. The
      default keyboard shortcuts are <strong>Alt-b</strong> and
      <strong>Alt-f</strong> in Unix, and Alt-left-arrow and Alt-right-arrow
      in Windows</dd>
  <dt>Button bar</dt>
    <dd>Two buttons: <img alt="Back " src="../Icons/Back.gif" /> 
     and <img alt="Forward "
      src="../Icons/Forward.gif" /> allow you to go back to
      the previous page or forward to the next one.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="Reloading">Reloading a page</a></h3>

<p>Documents can be reloaded using the <strong>Reload</strong> option in the
<strong>File</strong> menu, the shortcut <strong>Alt-r</strong> in Unix and
<strong>Control-r</strong> in Windows, or the <img src="../Icons/Reload.png"
alt="reload" /> button on the button bar.</p>

<h3><a name="Keyboard">Keyboard control</a></h3>

<p>Amaya provides keyboard control for many functions. Default keyboard
commands are provided at appropriate places in the documentation. The help
section on <a href="Configure.html">Configuring Amaya</a> describes how to
change the defaults, and the current key bindings are provided next to the
relevant menu option in all menus.</p>

<p>For Emacs users, a configuration file
<code>Amaya/config/amaya.emacs</code> is available. The user can create a
link from his own private space <code>$HOME/.amaya/amaya.keyboard</code> to
this file if he wants to work with Emacs shortcuts.</p>

<p>Some keys are predefined, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The key <strong>Enter</strong> within a <code>input</code> (type
    <code>text</code> or <code>password</code>) submits the corresponding
    form.</li>
  <li>The key <strong>Tab</strong> within a form element moves the cursor
    focus on the next form element, or skips to the first form element within
    the form.</li>
</ul>
