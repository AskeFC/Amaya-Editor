<h3><a name="purpose"></a><a name="L125">Is <b>Amaya</b> an editor or a
browser?</a></h3>
<p>
<b>Amaya</b> is mainly an authoring tool with browser features.We think that a
good editor needs to be also a browser, because the management of links and
the publishing are important parts of the editing task and they can be well
done only if the editor integrates  browsing  facilities.</p>
<p>

<h3><a name="download"></a><a name="Where">Where can I get
<b>Amaya</b>?</a></h3>
<p>
You can download <b>Amaya</b> distribution file in various formats, and using
either ftp or http:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
The page <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html</a>
gives access to ready to use Amaya application for a set of platforms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
The page <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html</a>
gives access to the source code of Amaya.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3><a name="download1"></a><a name="Where1"><a name="Amaya1">Is Amaya
available for MacOS platform?</a></a></h3>
<p>
Today we support Unix platforms and Windows platforms. We don't have the
resources needed for supporting another platform. But the source code  is
available and someone else could do the port</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Amaya3"><a name="release">Can I release Amaya on a
CD-ROM?</a></a></h2>
<p>
Yes, and you can charge for it, given the above requirements are met.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Amaya2"><a name="make">Can I make the changes and re-release
it?</a></a></h2>
<p>
Yes, we want people to experiment with and improve Amaya. It can even be used
in commercial software. If you make changes for the better, we encourage you
to contact us. You may<em> not</em> make changes and continue to call it by a
trademarked term or misrepresent the origin, capabilities, or liabilities
associated with its use. You may make valid assertions, such that it is based
on Amaya code, or that it is compliant with a Recommended Specification of the
W3C.</p>

<h3><a name="java"></a><a name="L147">Why is <b>Amaya</b> written in
C?</a></h3>
<p>
C has a number of advantages that fit well with our purposes. It's the most
portable and the most efficient language. Amaya is also based on a
pre-existing editing library, the Thotlib, which was written in C. It was
natural to continue to develop the Amaya code in C.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Amaya">Is Amaya fully compliant with MathML?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, but the current implementation of MathML in Amaya is not complete yet.
The Amaya documentation clearly indicates what is available. See section
"Current limitations" in <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Math.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Math.html</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="edit">Can I edit tags directly?</a></h2>
<p>
A plain text editing mode is difficult to handle in Amaya because Amaya works
on the document tree structure and not on its text form. Amaya is able to
download text documents and HTML documents. But when editing a text document,
the tree structure is a set of lines and when editing an HTML document the
structure tree is an HTML structure. To move from one to the other Amaya has
to rebuild the whole structure tree.</p>

<h3><a name="download2"></a><a name="Where2"><a name="Where3">Where I can get
the developers documentation</a></a></h3>
<p>
Those who want to extend or change the Amaya application need to read
following documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Overview of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/AmayaArchi.html">Amaya
architecture.</a>
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/APIman.toc.html">Thot API manual</a>
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Appman.toc.html">Thot Application
generation manual</a>
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/languages.toc.html">Thot language
manual</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="Amaya32"><a name="Make">Make complains with missing
files</a></a></h2>
<p>
You certainly miss to create the object subtree. As explained in <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html">Autoconf page</a>, you have
to create first a subtree (obj or any other name)  for object and lauch
configure to create the Makefile(s)</p>
<pre>cd Thot</pre>
<pre>mkdir obj </pre>
<pre>cd obj</pre>
<pre> ../configure</pre>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Amaya31"><a name="Make1">Make fails when compiling the HTML
schema</a></a></h2>
<p>
Thot compilers need a <strong>cpp</strong> preprocessor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you use GNU tools, configure should invoque the gcc compiler with right
options. You can check that the file <em>Options</em> has the following
definition:
<pre>CPP     = gcc -E -x c</pre>
</li>
<li>
In other case you have to be sure that <strong>cpp</strong> prepocessor  is in
your PATH.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<h2><a name="Amaya321"><a name="don't">I don't have Motif</a></a></h2>
<p>
Motif is not free available on Linux platforms.Amaya works fine with latests
versions (0.8.0 and later) of <a href="http://www.lesstif.org/">Lesstif</a> (a
free Motif clone).</p>
