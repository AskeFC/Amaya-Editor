<h2><a name="L125">I.1. Is <b>Amaya</b> an editor or a browser?</a></h2>
<p>
<b>Amaya</b> is mainly an authoring tool with browser features.  Link
management and remote publishing are important features in a hypertext editor,
and these features require seamless integration with browsing features.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Where">I.2. Where can I get <b>Amaya</b>?</a></h2>
<p>
You can download the <b>Amaya</b> distribution in various formats, and you can
use either ftp or http:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
The page at <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html</a>
gives access to a ready to use application for various platforms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
The page at <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html</a>
gives access to the source code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Amaya1">I.3. Is Amaya available for MacOS?</a></h2>
<p>
Currently, Amaya is available for various Unix and Windows platforms. We don't
have the resources for supporting additional platforms, but the source code is
available and contributions to a port are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="release">I.4. Can I release Amaya on a CD-ROM?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, and you can even charge for it, provided the copyright is preserved.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="make">I.5. Can I make some changes and re-release it?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, we encourage people to experiment with Amaya and to improve it. It can
even be used in commercial software. If you make changes for the better, we
encourage you to contact us. You may<em> not</em> make changes and continue to
call it by a trademarked term or misrepresent the origin, capabilities, or
liabilities associated with its use. You may make valid assertions, such that
it is based on the Amaya code, or that it is compliant with a Recommended
Specification of the W3C.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="L147">I.6. Why is <b>Amaya</b> written in C?</a></h2>
<p>
C has a number of advantages that fit well with our purposes. It's a very
portable and efficient language. Amaya is also based on a pre-existing editing
library, the Thotlib, which was itself written in C. It was natural to
continue to develop the Amaya code in C.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="I.7.">I.7. <b>Is Amaya Y2K compliant</b>?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes <b>Amaya</b> is Y2K compliant.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Amaya">II.1 Is Amaya compliant with MathML?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, but the current implementation of MathML 1.0 in Amaya is not complete
yet. The Amaya documentation clearly indicates what is available. See section
"Current limitations" in <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Math.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Math.html</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="edit">II.2. Can I edit tags directly?</a></h2>
<p>
Amaya has been built as a structured document editor.  This approach allows it
to handle complex documents and highly structured objects such as tables,
structured graphics or mathematical expressions. While editing, Amaya works on
the document tree, not on its textual representation, which is generated only
at save time, in the syntax you choose (plain text, HTML, XML).  That's why
you cannot edit tags.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Displayed">II.3. Fonts are too small. What can I do?</a></h2>
<p>
With Amaya you can zoom in and zoom out, document window by document window.
So each document displayed in a zoomed window will be displayed larger or
smaller than its normal size according of the current zoom factor. The Views
menu allows you to change the zoom factor for a single window.</p>
<p>
You can also change the zoom factor permanently. By default the zoom factor is
0 (documents are displayed with their own size). This default value can be
modified in the registry file ($HOME/.thotrc (Unix) or Thot/config/thot.rc
(Windows)). For example, you can add the following line in your registry:
ZOOM=3.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="want">II.4. How can I change the default window size</a></h2>
<p>
Parameters related to the windows displaying HTML documents are stored in the
<code>Thot/amaya/HTML.conf</code> file. In that file there are different
sections, one for each possible presentation. Normally you only act on the
first section:</p>
<pre>style HTMLP
open
  Formatted_view:        1 1 182 250
geometry
  Structure_view:        190 100 160 170
  Alternate_view:        190 1 156 99
  Links_view:            192 3 156 120
  Table_of_contents:     194 5 156 120
  Math_Structure_view:   195 6 156 80
  Graph_Structure_view:  197 8 156 80  </pre>
<p>
For each view there are four parameters: x, y, width and height. You can
change these default values. For Unix users we suggest you copy this file in
your home directory (<code>$HOME/HTML.conf</code>)  and you edit it.. So
modifications won't be lost next time Amaya is updated.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="parsing">II.5. Can I see parsing errors detected by
Amaya?</a></h2>
<p>
Amaya cannot be used to check documents validity. It accepts valid and invalid
documents and tries to dynamically correct detected errors. For example it's
able to add missing end-tags and to move misplaced elements.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless when Amaya find invalid tags and invalid attributes it generates
a log file which can be displayed by the command "Show log file" of the menu
"Special".</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="What">II.6. What is the reason</a> for a very liberal structure
enforcement?</h2>
<p>
Amaya has to cope with existing Web pages, and very few of them validate
against the HTML DTD. When designing Amaya, we were faced with a difficult
choice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Adopt a strict position and reject all invalid pages. Most users would be very
disapointed not to be able to see mainy pages that     other Web clients can
display;
</li>
<li>
Accept invalid pages and let Amaya fix the most common bugs.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We took the latest position and decided that Amaya should try to fix bugs, but
without losing information.  If an element is not valid in a given context,
Amaya tries to change the structure locally to make that element valid, but it
doesn't delete the element or move it to a different place, which could change
its meaning.</p>
<p>
The issue is that a DTD only specifies the structure of a document class, not
its semantics.  When you consider an invalid document, there are often several
ways to transform its structure to make it valid, but each transformation may
have a different impact on the document semantics. The DTD does not allow you
to choose the right transformation.</p>
<p>
Another important design decision that has been made for Amaya is that, even
if it accepts invalid documents, the structure and markup that it produces is
always valid. Obviously, only elements created or changed by Amaya itself are
concerned here. Some invalid parts of the original document may remain when
the document is saved.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="II.7.">II.7. How can I update the document title?</a></h2>
<p>
The user can change the document title by editing the field "Title" at the top
of the document window, but he/she has to confirm the change by hitting the
Return key.</p>
<p>
The document title can also be edited in the Structure view of the
document.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Where3">III.1. Where can I get the developer's
documentation</a></h2>
<p>
Those who want to extend or change the Amaya application need to read the
following documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Overview of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/AmayaArchi.html">Amaya
architecture.</a>
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/APIman.toc.html">Thot API manual</a>
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Appman.toc.html">Thot Application
generation manual</a>
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/languages.toc.html">Thot language
manual</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Make">III.2. Make complains with missing files</a></h2>
<p>
You certainly missed to create the object subtree. As explained in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html">Autoconf page</a>, you have
to create first a subtree (obj or any other name)  for object code and launch
configure to create the Makefile(s)</p>
<pre>cd Thot</pre>
<pre>mkdir obj </pre>
<pre>cd obj</pre>
<pre> ../configure</pre>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Make1">III.3. Make fails when compiling the HTML schema</a></h2>
<p>
Thot compilers need a <strong>cpp</strong> preprocessor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you use GNU tools, configure should invoke the gcc compiler with the right
options. You can check that file <em>Options</em> contains the following
definition:
<pre>CPP     = gcc -E -x c</pre>
</li>
<li>
In other cases you have to make sure that the <strong>cpp</strong>
preprocessor is in your PATH.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="don't">III.4. I don't have Motif</a></h2>
<p>
The Amaya user interface is based on OSF/Motif, and Motif is not freely
available on Linux. You can use <a href="http://www.lesstif.org/">Lesstif</a>
(a free Motif clone) instead. Amaya works fine with the latest versions (0.8.0
and later) of <a href="http://www.lesstif.org/">Lesstif</a>.</p>
