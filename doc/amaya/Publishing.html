<H1 style="text-align : center">Publishing in Amaya</H1>
<P>Currently <B>Amaya</B> does not offer a complete publishing solution,
as there is
no support for managing links between different HTML pages located on the same
server. <B>Amaya</B> neither provide any global view of the set of pages
installed on
a server. However it is possible to configure the action of saving files to a
remote server. Remote saving can be accessed in two way, through the
<STRONG>Save</STRONG> and <STRONG>SaveAs</STRONG> commands.</P>
<H3>The Save command</H3>
<P>The save command can be invoked either by choosing <STRONG>Save</STRONG>
from the <STRONG>File</STRONG> menu or by clicking on the <IMG
SRC="floppy.gif" align=middle> button. This command saves the current document
to the location it was fetched from. Newly added images are saved in the same
directory and no confirmation is asked. If one need to save newly added images
to a different location, the <STRONG>SaveAs</STRONG> command should be used
instead.</P>
<H3>The Save As command</H3>
<P>Selecting the <STRONG>Save As</STRONG> entry in the <STRONG>File</STRONG>
menu opens a dialog box that allows you to save the current document to a
different location, a remote Web server or the local file system.</P>
<UL>
<LI>saving to local disk
<LI>saving to a remote URL
<LI>copy images embedded in the document
<LI>transform embedded URLs to asbolute one
<LI>save images to a different location
</UL>
<P>Notice that for saving a document to a remote URL, you must have the right
to execute a PUT method on the remote machine. The WWW server has to be
explicitely configured to accept input from your machine or some
authentification mecanism will be involved. See the page on <A
href="Put.html">configuring your server to accept the PUT</A> method or ask
your Web administrator to do so.</P>
<P>Here is a dump of the <STRONG>Save As</STRONG> dialog box:</P>
<P><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="SaveAs.gif"></P>
<P>The items in the dialog box, from top to bottom, letf to right are used as
follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The <STRONG>Document directories</STRONG> selector shows the directories
contained in the current directory. It should be used to save a file on the
local file system.
<LI>The <STRONG>Files</STRONG> selector shows the files contained in the
current directory.
<LI>The <STRONG>Copy Images</STRONG> toggle indicates whether the images
embbeded in the current document must be copied along with the document to the
new location. It's generally better to let this switch on since otherwise you
are not sure that the corresponding images will be found when opening the
document later. However switching it off is useful when you have only changed
the text of the document and when a remote mirror has to be updated.
<LI>The <STRONG>Transform URLs</STRONG> toggle transforms all relative URLs
contained in the document to absolute ones (i.e. containing the full document
location). This ensures that all the links in the document remain correct
after the copy. However if you have several document linked together with
relative URLs and that you plan to move them to a remote location, disabling
URL conversion is needed to avoid referencing the initial locations.
<LI>The <STRONG>Document location</STRONG> field indicates the location where
the HTML file has to be written. This can be a file in the local filesystem
(e.g. "/pub/html/welcome.html") or the name of a remote URL (e.g.
"http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Welcome.html").
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG> that this should be a complete path, there is no way
actually to guess what would be the name of "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW". You
should also make sure that you have the right to do a PUT method in the case
of a remote location. See the page on <A href="Put.html">configuring your
server to accept the PUT method</A> or ask your Web administrator.</P>
<LI>The <STRONG>Images location</STRONG> field allows you to save images (if
<STRONG>Copy Images</STRONG> has been selected) to a different place than the
HTML file. This field should contain the name of a directory in the local
filesystem or a location in the remote server.
<UL>
<LI>using a relative path, the images is stored at a location relative to the
document directory. For example, if the document location is
"http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Welcome.html" and the images location is "Images",
an image "W3C.png" contained in the document is stored at the URL
"http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Images/W3C.png" and the HTML file is modified to
reference it as:
<P>&lt;IMG SRC="Images/W3C.png"></P>
<P>This is similar in the case of a document location in the local
filesystem.</P>
<LI>using an absolute path, the images are stored at this exact location,
independantly of the document location. In the previous example, if the images
location specified is "/pub/WWW/Img", the image is stored at
"http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Img/W3C.png" and the corresponding HTML file is
modified in the following way:
<P>&lt;IMG SRC="/pub/WWW/Img/W3C.png"></P>
<P>Moreover, it is possible to indicate a full URL like
"http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Img" and the SRC attribute of all images will
contain an absolute URL.</P>
</UL>
<LI>Clicking on <STRONG>OK</STRONG> starts the process of transforming the
document and a popup asks for confirmation, showing all the URL to be written
to.
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG> that <B>Amaya</B> does not currently contact the
remote server (in case of an "http://..." destination) to check whether such a
document already exists.</P>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Notes</STRONG> :</P>
<UL>
<LI>When saving to a remote location please check that the http_proxy is not
set, or that the proxy server and the <A href="Put.html">target server are
configured to work with the PUT</A> method.
</UL>
