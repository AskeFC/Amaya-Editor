<h1>How to install the Windows Amaya Binary Release</h1>
<p>
The Amaya installation process is automatic. You have to doubleclick on the
amaya setup program and follow the instructions of the setup process. A short
cut is automatically added to the Windows start menu and you can use your own
short cut by creating it from the amaya icon generated by the setup
program.</p>
<p>
If you choose to install amaya in the directory X (example: <code>C:\Program
Files</code>), the setup program will create a new directory called
<code>X:\Thot</code> populated with a few files and directories. The
<code>amaya.exe</code> file is located in the directory
<code>X:\Thot\Windows\bin</code>.</p>
<p>
There are two different Amaya versions: one without dictionary and one
including French and English dictionaries. Both unclude online
documentation.</p>
