<h1>W3C Activity: Amaya</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The first tools made widely available to end users on the Web were browsers.
Then some help was provided to authors by such tools as filters or text
editors with an HTML mode. Recently, specialized editors were proposed for
HTML. With the evolution of Web documents towards a richer structure and a
number of additional formats (graphics, multimedia objects, math, style
sheets, etc), more sophisticated tools are needed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> has been designed as a new generation of client
software that can integrate all aspects of the Web and that still remains user
friendly.</p>
<p>
The main purpose of <strong>Amaya</strong> is to serve as a testbed to
experiment new Web protocols and formats, and to test and demonstrate new
features proposed for existing Web standards.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
As the Web technology is evolving very fast, a tool like
<strong>Amaya</strong> must be able to change very fast, taking into account
the latest proposed extensions to Web protocols and formats. Therefore,
<strong>Amaya</strong> should provide an extensible framework.</p>
<p>
For allowing in-depth evaluation of new features the software must be
available on several platforms, it must be extensible and easy to use, and
have good performances.</p>

<h3>A full featured client</h3>
<p>
For testing all aspects of Web protocols and formats, <strong>Amaya</strong>
must include not only a browser but also an editor for Web documents. Both
functions must be integrated seamlessly. This allows new features that are not
yet widely deployed to be tested and validated from different points of
view.</p>

<h3>A sample implementation of HTML</h3>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> currently implements the full <a
href="../TR/REC-html32">HTML 3.2</a> recommendation, and should implement the
latest recommendation, <a href="../TR/REC-html40">HTML 4.0</a>.</p>

<h3>A sample implementation of CSS</h3>
<p>
<a href="../Style/">Cascading Style Sheets</a> are implemented in some
browsers (<a href="../Arena/">Arena</a> is one of them), but document
designers need tools for creating style sheets. <strong>Amaya</strong> must
support CSS and provide a convenient user interface for the design of style
sheets.</p>

<h3>A testbed for new protocols</h3>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> should be used for experimenting the specifications
developed in various areas, such as <a
href="../International/">Internationalization</a>, <a
href="../PICS/">PICS</a>, <a href="../Math">Math</a>, HTTP or metadata..</p>

<h2>Current situation</h2>

<h3>Releases</h3>
<p>
The <a href="User/BinDist.html">binary version</a> of <strong>Amaya</strong>
for Unix platforms was first released to W3C members and to the public in July
and August 1996, respectively.</p>
<p>
The Windows version, first released in July 1997,  is much more stable now,
but it is still missing a few features, such as printing documents and image
map editing. We are working on these features, which should be available by
end of January 1998. The Unix and Windows versions will then support exactly
the same features.</p>
<p>
Since February 1997, the <a href="User/SourceDist.html">source code</a> has
been available to the public.</p>
<p>
We have two distributions of Amaya. A pure C version based on Libwww and a
version embedding a Java virtual machine. The later uses the HTTP classes from
Jigsaw.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
The current version of <strong>Amaya</strong> constitutes a strong basis on
which developers can make extensions and experiments. It includes the
following features:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Editing/browsing</dt>
<dd>
Browsing and editing with a direct manipulation user interface and a
structured representation of documents
</dd>
<dt>Java support</dt>
<dd>
Integration of a Java virtual machine, to support applications and extensions
written in Java. An API is available from the Java language offering an easy
customization path for Amaya users.
</dd>
<dt>HTML</dt>
<dd>
Full support of <a href="../TR/REC-html32">HTML 3.2</a> and support of many <a
href="../TR/REC-html40">HTML 4.0</a> features, such as:
<ul>
<li>
OBJECT element with a general mechanism for the insertion of multimedia
objects and a wide range of other media plug-ins.
<li>
SPAN element, to attach style or language to inline elements.
<li>
The HTML 4.0 table model 
<li>
The LANG attribute (with multilingual hyphenation and spell checking), ID (for
CSS and links) - CLASS (for CSS).
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>CSS</dt>
<dd>
Support for a large subset of CSS1 properties. The current implementation
should be considered as an experiment but the plan is to revisit this part of
the Amaya code.
</dd>
<dt>HTTP</dt>
<dd>
Access to remote sites for both browsing and publishing, using HTTP 1.1. Two
different implementations of this protocol can be used: <a
href="../Library/">libwww</a> or the Java classes from <a
href="../Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a>.
</dd>
<dt>MathML</dt>
<dd>
A prototype implementation of <a href="../TR/WD-math/">MathML</a> to browse
web pages containing mathematical expressions and to edit such pages.
</dd>
<dt>Graphics</dt>
<dd>
Amaya displays images including those in the PNG format.<br>
A CGM plug-in has been developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
</dd>
<dt>PICS</dt>
<dd>
A <a href="../../../PICS/refcode/">modification</a> of Amaya has been made to
support PICS based filters using the new <a
href="../../../TR/PR-PICSRules">PICSRules</a> profile language.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Next step</h2>
<p>
The public release 1.1b of Amaya, includhing the Windows version, is now
available.</p>
<p>
During next months, we plan to develop <strong>Amaya</strong> in the following
directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
CSS: improvements to the current implementation and extensions
<li>
HTML: a more complete implementation of HTML 4.0
<li>
XML: extension of the current MathML implementation and support for other XML
applications
<li>
DOM: demonstration of DOM Level 1 in Java
<li>
I18N: at least support for western languages. Eastern languages will take more
time.
<li>
WAI: we propose to integrate WAI recommendations in Amaya
</ul>
<p>
Contributions are expected for adding more features in future versions.</p>
