<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Amaya is W3C's own versatile editor/browser. With the extremely fast moving
nature of Web technology, Amaya plays a central role at the Consortium. Easily
extended to integrate new ideas into its design, Amaya provides developers
with many specialized features including multiple views, where the internal
structural model of the document can be displayed alongside the browser's view
of how it should be presented on the screen. Amaya has a counterpart called <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> which plays a similar role
on the server side. Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring environment
and comes equipped with a WYSIWYG style of interface, similar to that of the
more popular commercial browsers.</p>

<p>An important benefit of Amaya is that it implements the W3C specifications
very carefully so that you can sure that the mark-up you produce follows W3C
Recommendations correctly, making for more efficient mark-up which is easy to
maintain or re-purpose for other devices.</p>

<p>Amaya maintains a consistent internal document model adhering to the
Document Type Definition (DTD), meaning that it handles the relationships
between various document components: paragraphs, headings, lists and so on, as
laid down in the relevant W3C HTML Recommendation. Amaya has been extended to
demonstrate many features in HTML 4.0, the current recommendation for the
language and XHTML, the next generation of HTML.</p>

<h2><a name="role">Amaya at W3C</a></h2>

<p>Amaya has been developed at W3C by the Amaya team: Irène Vatton, Ramzi
Guétari, José Kahan, Vincent Quint. Used by other groups within the consortium
to demonstrate work and to act as an experimental platform Amaya has played an
important role in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>HTML:</b> As an editor, Amaya is guaranteed to produce HTML 4
    compliant code. The way it handles documents strictly follows the HTML
    DTD, the Document Type Definition.</li>
  <li><b>XHTML:</b> Amaya can also handle documents in XHTML, i.e. using the
    XML syntax. Due to namespaces, it can seamlessly integrate and manipulate
    structured objects such as mathematical expressions and vector
  graphics.</li>
  <li><b>HTTP protocol:</b> In its basic version, Amaya implements many web
    protocols and formats: it accesses remote sites by means of HTTP 1.1, as
    implemented in <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">libwww</a>.
    Amaya takes advantage of the most advanced features of HTTP, such as
    content negotiation to retrieve, for instance, the most appropriate
    picture format, keep alive connections to save bandwidth and
    authentication to allow secure remote publishing.</li>
  <li><p><b>Math on the Web:</b> Amaya demonstrates an implementation of <a
    href="../TR/WD-math/">MathML</a> which allows users to browse and edit web
    pages containing mathematical expressions. The screen below shows the way
    that you can display equations on the screen side by side the MathML model
    used by Amaya.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img width="540" height="614" src="amaya-math.gif" alt="Amaya screen with
equations"></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Graphics:</b> Amaya displays images in the PNG format,  which is a
    more powerful graphics format than GIF and more suited to the needs of the
    Web. A CGM plug-in developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratories was first
    demonstrated at EITC'97 in Brussels and in many other events. An
    experiment with 2D vector graphics was made in Amaya, to prepare the work
    on Scalable Vector Graphics (<a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a>). The graphics are written
    in XML and may be mixed freely with HTML and MathML.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Style sheets:</b> Amaya has extensive support for the W3C style
    sheet language CSS and offers <a href="User/CSS.html">a simple-to-use
    interface</a> enabling users to write style sheets for Web documents
    without having to know the details of the syntax associated with style
    sheet rules and properties. You can create colored text, change the font,
    set the background color and control other presentational effects. CSS
    style sheets may also be used to alter the look of graphics or
    mathematical expressions.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>DOM:</b> Amaya is used to experiment with the Java API developed
    by the Document Object Model (<a href="/DOM/Activity">DOM</a>)
    activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Internationalization:</b> It is now possible to launch Amaya so
    that the user dialogs are in various languages such as English, German or
    French. Other languages may be added by users. Amaya can also handle
    multilingual documents and it takes the current language into account when
    spell-checking or hyphenating.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="current">Current Situation</a></h2>

<p>The current version, Amaya 3.0 (31 March 2000), is a public release,
available both in <a href="User/SourceDist.html">source code</a> and <a
href="User/BinDist.html">ready to use</a> forms. The Amaya software is written
in C and  is available for both Windows and Unix platforms and can be <a
href="Overview.html#L347">downloaded</a> from the W3C site.</p>

<p>Documentation is provided at every level, catering for the beginner right
through to the developer wanting to extend the software for their own
purposes. There is also an active and very useful mailing lists, <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/">www-amaya@w3.org</a> and
<a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya-dev/">www-amaya-dev@w3.org</a>
where users can discuss Amaya features and how they work, making note of any
problems experienced using the software.</p>

<p>The <a href="User/cvs.html">Amaya CVS base</a> is publicly available. It
has world read-only access, but a write access may be opened to other
developers.</p>

<p>The latest release includes the following new features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A better support of CSS: margin, border, and padding rules are now
    supported.</li>
  <li>The support of MathML 2.0 attributes and the improvement of the maths
    editing.</li>
  <li>The improvement of the table formatter.</li>
  <li>The unicodification of the Amaya code.</li>
</ul>

<p>but also these interesting features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for HTML 4.0 &amp; XHTML 1.0</li>
  <li>Facilities for creating documents from templates</li>
  <li>Source code can be displayed and edited in sync with the formatted
    document</li>
  <li>Ability to choose and experiment style sheets from stored locations</li>
  <li>CSS style sheets can be downloaded, edited and published</li>
  <li>Ability to print a document with style sheets</li>
  <li>Full presentation part of MathML</li>
  <li>Support of the HTTP 1.1 message digest authentication, lost update, and
    language negotiation</li>
  <li>Profiles for tailoring Amaya to specific needs</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="future">What the Future Holds</a></h2>

<p>The intention is for Amaya to support XML and twe already started an
important work on this front. We hope to implement some style sheet support
for XML, most probably in the form of CSS. Future releases should also see
support for SVG graphics.</p>

<p>At the same time, an Amaya version based on the GTK toolkits has been
experimented. The current Amaya source release includes the code of this GTK
prototype. Our plan is to continue that effort with the help of external
contributors.</p>

<p>The team will continue to work with other W3C activities to help
demonstrate and test new developments in a variety of areas.</p>
