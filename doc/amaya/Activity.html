<p class="splash">
Work on Amaya is being managed as part of W3C's User Interface domain.</p>
<blockquote>

Activity statements provide a managerial overview of W3C's work in this area.
They are designed to be read from beginning to end, to be informative and
interesting. The role of W3C is given, also the benefits to the Web community,
accomplishments to date and a summary of what the future holds. Background
reading pages to help set the scene and explain any technical concepts are in
preparation. Where necessary these also contain a short tutorial.

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Amaya is W3C's own test-bed browser/editor. With the extremely fast moving
nature of Web technology, Amaya plays a central role at the Consortium. Easily
extended to integrate new ideas into its design, Amaya provides developers
with many specialized features including multiple views, where the internal
structural model of the document can be displayed alongside the browser's view
of how it should be presented on the screen. Amaya has a counterpart called <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> which plays a similar role
on the server side. Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring environment
and comes equipped with a WYSIWYG style of interface, similar to that of the
more popular commercial browsers.</p>
<p>
Amaya maintains a consistent internal document model adhering to the Document
Type Definition (DTD), meaning that it handles the relationships between
various document components: paragraphs, headings, lists and so on, as laid
down in the relevant W3C HTML Recommendation. Amaya has been extended to
demonstrate many features in HTML 4.0, the current recommendation for the
language.</p>

<h2><a name="role">Amaya at W3C</a></h2>
<p>
Amaya has been developed at W3C by the Amaya team: Ir&egrave;ne Vatton,
Ramzi Gu&eacute;tari, Jos&eacute; Kahan, Vincent Quint, Daniel Veillard. Used
by other groups within the consortium to demonstrate work and to act as an
experimental platform Amaya has played an important role in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<b>Math on the Web:</b> Amaya demonstrates an implementation of <a
href="../TR/WD-math/">MathML</a> which allows users to browse and edit web
pages containing mathematical expressions. The screen below shows the way that
you can display equations on the screen side by side the MathML model used
by Amaya.</p>
</ul>
<p>
<img width="350" height="400" src="Icons/amaya-math.gif"
alt="Amaya screen with equations"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<b>HTTP protocol:</b> In its basic version, Amaya implements many web
protocols and formats: it accesses remote sites by means of HTTP 1.1, as
implemented in <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">libwww</a>. Amaya
takes advantage of the most advanced features of HTTP, such as content
negotiation to retrieve the most appropriate picture format, for instance, or
keep alive connections to save bandwidth.</p>
<li><p>
<b>Graphics:</b> Amaya displays images in the PNG format, more powerful
graphics format than GIF and more suited to the needs of the Web. A CGM
plug-in (CGM is commonly used vector graphics format in computer drawing
packages) developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratories was demonstrated at
EITC'97 in Brussels.</p>
<li><p>
<b>Style sheets:</b> Amaya has extensive support for the W3C style sheet
language CSS and offers a simple-to-use interface enabling users to write
style sheets for Web documents without having to know the details of the
syntax associated with style sheet rules and properties. You can create
colored text, change the font, set the background color and control other
presentational effects.</p>
<li><p>
<b>HTML 4:</b> As an editor, Amaya is guaranteed to produce HTML 4 compliant
code. The way it handles documents is strictly according to the HTML DTD, the
Document Type Definition.</p>
<li><p>
<b>DOM:</b> Amaya is used to experiment with the Java API developed by the DOM
working group.</p>
<li><p>
<b>Amaya in other languages:</b> It is now possible to launch Amaya so that
the user dialogs are in German or French. The intention is to cover other
languages in the future.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="current">Current Situation</a></h2>
<p>
The Amaya software is available for both Windows and Unix platforms and can be
downloaded from the W3C site.</p>
<p>
Documentation is provided at every level, catering for the beginner right
through to the developer wanting to extend the software for their own
purposes. There is also an active and very useful mailing list where users can
discuss Amaya features and how they work, making note of any problems
experienced using the software.</p>
<p>
The pure C Amaya 1.2a beta public release is available in source code and
precompiled binary forms, as is the Amaya-Java 1.1c beta public release.</p>
<p>
There are two distributions of Amaya. A pure C version based on libwww and a
version embedding a Java virtual machine. The later uses the HTTP classes from
Jigsaw. This is a an object-oriented server for HTTP 1.1 written in Java. An
API is available from the Java language offering an easy customization path
for Amaya users.</p>

<h2><a name="future">What the Future Holds</a></h2>
<p>
The next release of Amaya, Amaya 1.3, should be ready July 1998. There are a
number of improvements, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Better printer support: an increased range of printers will be supported in
the Windows version of Amaya. Currently you are limited to output to a
Postscript file.</p>
<li><p>
Implementation of the new version of the PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
library.</p>
<li><p>
Zoom control for each document. You will be able to set a zoom setting so that
text and images increase in size according to a zoom value.</p>
<li><p>
Better formatting and printing of tables.</p>
<li><p>
Style sheets: increased support of CSS style sheets with better interactive
interface for generating your own style sheets for documents.</p>
<li><p>
Implementation the new version of libwww.</p>
</ul>
<p>
Beyond this, the Amaya team will be working on a fuller implementation of CSS
extending to CSS2, on the progressive display of images and on features to
support internationalization. The team will continue to work with other W3C
Activities to help demonstrate and test new developments in a variety of
areas.</p>
