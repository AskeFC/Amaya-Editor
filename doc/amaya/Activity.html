<blockquote>

<a href="/Consortium/Activities">Activity statements</a> provide a managerial
overview of W3C's work in this area. They are designed to be read from
beginning to end, to be informative and interesting. The role of W3C is given,
also the benefits to the Web community, accomplishments to date and a summary
of what the future holds. Background reading pages to help set the scene and
explain any technical concepts are in preparation. Where necessary these also
contain a short tutorial.

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Amaya is W3C's own test-bed browser/editor. With the extremely fast moving
nature of Web technology, Amaya plays a central role at the Consortium. Easily
extended to integrate new ideas into its design, Amaya provides developers
with many specialized features including multiple views, where the internal
structural model of the document can be displayed alongside the browser's view
of how it should be presented on the screen. Amaya has a counterpart called <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> which plays a similar role
on the server side. Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring environment
and comes equipped with a WYSIWYG style of interface, similar to that of the
more popular commercial browsers.</p>
<p>
Amaya maintains a consistent internal document model adhering to the Document
Type Definition (DTD), meaning that it handles the relationships between
various document components: paragraphs, headings, lists and so on, as laid
down in the relevant W3C HTML Recommendation. Amaya has been extended to
demonstrate many features in HTML 4.0, the current recommendation for the
language.</p>

<h2><a name="role">Amaya at W3C</a></h2>
<p>
Amaya has been developed at W3C by the Amaya team: Ir&egrave;ne Vatton, Ramzi
Gu&eacute;tari, Jos&eacute; Kahan, Vincent Quint, Daniel Veillard. Used by
other groups within the consortium to demonstrate work and to act as an
experimental platform Amaya has played an important role in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Math on the Web:</b> Amaya demonstrates an implementation of <a
href="../TR/WD-math/">MathML</a> which allows users to browse and edit web
pages containing mathematical expressions. The screen below shows the way that
you can display equations on the screen side by side the MathML model used by
Amaya.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img width="350" height="400" src="Icons/amaya-math.gif" alt="Amaya screen
with equations"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>HTTP protocol:</b> In its basic version, Amaya implements many web
protocols and formats: it accesses remote sites by means of HTTP 1.1, as
implemented in <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">libwww</a>. Amaya
takes advantage of the most advanced features of HTTP, such as content
negotiation to retrieve the most appropriate picture format, for instance, or
keep alive connections to save bandwidth.
</li>
<li>
<b>Graphics:</b> Amaya displays images in the PNG format, more powerful
graphics format than GIF and more suited to the needs of the Web. CGM is
commonly used vector graphics format in computer drawing packages. A CGM
plug-in developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratories was first demonstrated
at EITC'97 in Brussels and in many other events.
</li>
<li>
<b>Style sheets:</b> Amaya has extensive support for the W3C style sheet
language CSS and offers a simple-to-use interface enabling users to write
style sheets for Web documents without having to know the details of the
syntax associated with style sheet rules and properties. You can create
colored text, change the font, set the background color and control other
presentational effects.
</li>
<li>
<b>HTML 4:</b> As an editor, Amaya is guaranteed to produce HTML 4 compliant
code. The way it handles documents is strictly according to the HTML DTD, the
Document Type Definition.
</li>
<li>
<b>DOM:</b> Amaya is used to experiment with the Java API developed by the
Document Object Model (<a href="/DOM/Activity">DOM</a>) activity.
</li>
<li>
<b>Amaya in other languages:</b> It is now possible to launch Amaya so that
the user dialogs are in German or French. The intention is to cover other
languages in the future.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="current">Current Situation</a></h2>
<p>
The Amaya software is available for both Windows and Unix platforms and can be
<a href="Overview.html#L347">downloaded</a> from the W3C site.</p>
<p>
Documentation is provided at every level, catering for the beginner right
through to the developer wanting to extend the software for their own
purposes. There is also an active and very useful mailing list where users can
discuss Amaya features and how they work, making note of any problems
experienced using the software.</p>
<p>
The current version, Amaya 1.4a, is a public release, available both in <a
href="User/SourceDist.html">source code</a> and <a
href="User/BinDist.html">ready to use</a> forms.</p>
<p>
The publicly released version is written in C. There is also a version with
Java support, not publicly available at the moment. If there is enough
interest for this version it could be released. This version embeds a Java
virtual machine and uses the HTTP classes from Jigsaw, the object-oriented
server for HTTP 1.1 written in Java. An API is available from the Java
language offering an easy customization path for Amaya users.</p>

<h2><a name="future">What the Future Holds</a></h2>
<p>
Minor releases are expected to fix reported bugs.</p>
<p>
We're starting work on opening our Amaya CVS base to the public. In a first
time, it'll have world read-only access. This should take place in one or two
months. Depending on the response and on the quality of contributions, we may
open a write access to other people afterwards.</p>
<p>
Beyond this, the Amaya team will be working on a fuller implementation of CSS,
on Undo and configuration facilies and on features to support
internationalization. The team will continue to work with other W3C activities
to help demonstrate and test new developments in a variety of areas.</p>
