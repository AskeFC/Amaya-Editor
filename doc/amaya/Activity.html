<h1>W3C Activity: Amaya</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The first tools made widely available to end users on the Web were browsers.
Then some help was provided to authors by such tools as filters or text
editors with an HTML mode. Recently, more specialized editors were proposed
for HTML. With the evolution of HTML towards a richer structure (tables,
divisions) and a number of additional formats (graphics, objects, multimedia,
style sheets, etc), more sophisticated tools are needed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> has been designed as a new generation of client
software that can integrate all aspects of the Web and that still remains user
friendly.</p>
<p>
The main purpose of <strong>Amaya</strong> is to serve as a testbed to
experiment new Web protocols and formats, to test and demonstrate new features
proposed for existing Web standards.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
As the Web technology is evolving very fast, a tool like
<strong>Amaya</strong> must be able to change very fast, taking into account
the latest proposed extensions to Web protocols and formats. Therefore,
<strong>Amaya</strong> should provide an extensible framework.</p>
<p>
For allowing in-depth evaluation of new features the software must be
available on several platforms, it must be extensible and easy to use, and
have good performances.</p>

<h3>A full featured client</h3>
<p>
For testing all aspects of Web protocols and formats, <strong>Amaya</strong>
must include not only a browser but also an editor for HTML documents. Both
functions must be integrated seamlessly. This allows new features that are not
yet widely deployed to be tested and validated from different points of
view.</p>

<h3>A sample implementation of HTML</h3>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> currently implements the latest version of HTML, <a
href="../MarkUp/Wilbur/">HTML 3.2</a>. It is also used to test and experiment
new extensions of HTML (<a href="../TR/WD-html40/cover.html">HTML 4.0</a>),
such as a richer model of tables, more structured forms, multimedia objects,
or I18N features.</p>

<h3>A sample implementation of CSS</h3>
<p>
<a href="../Style/">Cascading Style Sheets</a> are implemented in some
browsers (<a href="../Arena/">Arena</a> is one of them), but document
designers need tools for creating style sheets. <strong>Amaya</strong> must
support CSS1 and provide a user interface for the design of style sheets.</p>

<h3>A testbed for new protocols</h3>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> should be used for experimenting the specifications
developed in various areas, such as <a
href="../International/">Internationalization</a>, <a
href="../PICS/">PICS</a>, or electronic payment.</p>

<h2>Current situation</h2>
<p>
The <a href="User/BinDist.html">binary version</a> of <strong>Amaya</strong>
was first released to W3C members and to the public in July and August 1996,
respectively.</p>
<p>
Since February 1997, the <a href="User/SourceDist.html">source code</a> has
been available to the public.</p>
<p>
The current version of <strong>Amaya</strong> constitutes a strong basis on
which any developer can make extensions and experiments. It includes the
following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
browsing and editing with a direct manipulation user interface and a
structured representation of documents 
<li>
support for a large subset of CSS1 properties 
<li>
publishing on remote servers 
<li>
full support of HTML 3.2 and support of some <a
href="../TR/WD-html40/cover.html">HTML 4.0r</a> features, such as: 
<ul>
<li>
OBJECT element and the associated plug-in mechanism. 
<li>
LANG attribute to support internationalization. The spell-checker and the
hyphenation algorithm take the current language of each element into account. 
<li>
ID attribute to associate CSS1 rules to specific elements or to identify link
targets. 
</ul>
<li>
Integration of a Java virtual machine, to support applications and extensions
written in Java: 
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="../Jigsaw">Jigsaw</a> HTTP/1.1 classes provide network access and
a user cache. 
<li><p>
An API is available from the Java language offering an easy customization path
for Amaya users.</p>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
It is available for X11/UNIX workstations. A demo version for Windows will
soon be available.</p>

<h2>Next step</h2>
<p>
It is expected that the next extensions to <strong>Amaya</strong> be done</p>
<ul>
<li>
by the W3C staff 
<li>
by other interested parties 
</ul>
<p>
During next months, the W3C plans to develop <strong>Amaya</strong> in the
following directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
A more complete implementation of CSS1 
<li>
A richer formatting model that makes provision for future extensions of CSS 
<li>
Support for printing with CSS 
<li>
A stable Windows version 
<li>
Full support of HTML-Cougar 
<li>
Extend the event model and the Java API to support dynamic documents 
<li>
Make experiments with XML: Mathematics and xml-links 
</ul>
<p>
Contributions are expected for adding more features in future versions:
integration of applets, document management, templates of specific document
types, export to other document formats, cscw, etc.</p>
