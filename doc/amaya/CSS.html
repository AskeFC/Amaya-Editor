<h1 style="text-align : center">Cascading Style Sheet support in Amaya</h1>
<p>
This document describes the current state of the <a
href="../../Style">Cascading Style Sheet</a> support in Amaya. The
implementation is based on the <a href="/TR/PR-CSS1">CSS1 proposal</a> . We
focussed on providing as many features as possible and offering an easy to use
and learn interface. Considering the second point we choosed a "learn by
example" approach suitable for users not experienced with style sheets.</p>
<p>
This document contains the following sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Section "<a href="#L392">Presentation</a>" gives a short overview of the CSS.
</li>
<li>
Section  "<a href="#L393">Interface</a>" details the CSS specific areas of the
Amaya interface.
</li>
<li>
Section "<a href="#L394">Current State</a>" presents the CSS functionnalities
that are currently implemented.
</li>
<li>
Section "<a href="#L395">What's lacking</a>" explains the main points to be
improved or added.
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="L392">Presentation</a></h3>
<p>
CSS defines a syntax to describe presentation associated with elements as a
set of properties (like colors, fonts, etc.). Associated to properties, a
selector restrict the application of these rules to a set of element depending
on their type (like H1, or LI), their context (like an EM in a H3) or classes
applied  to an element. A set of rules defines which properties should be
applied when more than one selector match a given element. While this is
relatively simple for someone used to handle structured documents, the
experience has shown that a new user may have difficulties to modelize a
document as a structured entity. This might be a problem when trying to
introduce the CSS to a large audience.</p>
<p>
Thus, the challenge is to build a tool simple enough so that inexperienced
people can use styles when creating HTML pages with Amaya, while retaining all
the possibilities of CSS. The interface was also designed to not hide the
underlying complexity of the document structure (Structure View) and of the
CSS language (CSS rules may be shown), in order to shorten the learning curve
to structured presentation design.</p>
<p>
One of the strongest features of CSS is the cascading model. Presentation
rules can be fetched from different remote files, tied to the document or
associated to one specific element in a page. This allows sharing and reuse of
sets of rules whilst allowing specific presentation. It allows also the use of
an user defined set of rules to accomodate his preferences. We tried to give a
complete and simple view of the cascading model, showing separately specific
presentation (Structure View), document specific rules (Structure View and CSS
dialog box) and all the set of rules associated to the external files
referenced by the document. It is possible to manipulate rules in one file but
also to move them from one file to another, allowing a user to take
presentation rules from a remote server and apply them selectively to his own
pages, in the purpose of building a pool of presentation rules.</p>

<h3><a name="L393">User interface</a></h3>
<p>
We first present the Style interface as provided by the current version of
Amaya:</p>
<p>
The Amaya menu bar contains a <strong>Style</strong> menu containing all the
actions related to presentation and style manipulation. Entries in that menu
are ordered from the most specific to the most generic operations, except the
two last ones, which are not related to CSS, but to HTML (<strong>Information
type</strong> and <strong>Character element</strong>).</p>
<ul>
<li>
Three entries call dialog boxes that associate presentation with the currently
selected elements:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Character Style</strong> allows one to select font attributes (size,
style, family and underline)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Colors</strong> allows one to choose the  foreground and background
colors from a palette.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Format</strong> allows one to set  alignment, indentation,
justification and linespacing.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Background Image</strong> allows one to insert a background image and
to select the repeat mode.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All modifications made with these dialog boxes can be viewed immediately in
the WYSIWYG view and the Structure view.</p>
</li>
<li>
Two entries are related to classes:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Create Rule</strong> uses the style of the selected element to define
a new class with the same. A list of the existing classes is proposed, the
type of the current element being the default. This is the first step toward
defining CSS rules. Presentation is moved from the selected element to the
document header, defining a new CSS rule. All elements of the new class take
the new style.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Apply class</strong> uses one of the existing classes and applies it
to the selected elements. These elements are then displayed with the style
associated with class chosen.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The <strong>Style sheet</strong> item gives access to the current list of
downloaded CSS files:
<p>
<img src="../Icons/css.gif"></p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="L394">Current State</a></h3>
<p>
Here, we focus on what is currently supported from the CSS1 proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Parsing:
<ul>
<li>
all the basic:
<ul>
<li>
grouping selectors in one rule
</li>
<li>
grouping properties in one rule
</li>
<li>
comments
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
classes and pseudoclasses
</li>
<li>
context sensitive selector
</li>
<li>
standard units
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Cascading order should be fine.
</li>
<li>
CSS properties: Everything should be parsed correctly, but the back-end may
lack support for some attributes (see <a href="CSSStatus.html">CSSStatus</a>
file for more details).
<ul>
<li>
Text: text-align, text-decoration and text-indent.
</li>
<li>
Fonts: Times, Helvetica and Courrier are available, with various character
style and a set of prefefined size (from 6 to 60 points).
</li>
<li>
Box Properties: not supported in this version.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is support for users preferences which can be provided in
<tt><code>$(HOME)/.amaya.css</code></tt> (Unix) or
<code>Thot/amaya/amaya.css</code> (Windows).</p>

<h3><a name="L395">What's lacking</a></h3>
<p>
First, considering the current draft compliance, the main issues for full CSS1
support are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <strong>Print</strong> command does not currently render presentation
defined in style sheets.
</li>
<li>
The CSS1 formatting model for border, margins and padding is not yet
implemented.
</li>
<li>
Pseudo elements are difficult to handle.
</li>
<li>
The current implementation is a bit restrictive on colors and fonts.
</li>
</ul>
