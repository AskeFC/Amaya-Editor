<H1>How to install the Amaya Binary Release</H1>

<P>
<IMG src="warning.gif"> In the following, we
assume that the path stored in the archive begins with the
<CODE><STRONG>Thot</STRONG></CODE> directory (this change was introduced for
the source distribution), however older binary distribution uses
<CODE><STRONG>Amaya</STRONG></CODE> as the top directory name instead.</P>
<H3>Choose a place for Amaya</H3>

<P>
Supposing the binary distribution was loaded fine, one must choose a place to
install it. We suggest</P>
<UL>
<LI>/usr/local for a system wide installation
<LI>the user home directory for a personnal installation
</UL>
<P>
A Linux version doesn't need more that 5 Megabytes of disk space, even a RISC
architecture distribution should not exceed 10 Megabytes.</P>
<H3>Extract the distribution</H3>

<P>
Move the distribution to this directory, verify the rights on this directory
allows you to create a directory and extract the distribution.</P>
<P>
On a <STRONG>Linux ELF</STRONG> platform one must invoke:</P>
<P>
<CODE>tar xvzf amaya-linux-elf.tar.gz</CODE></P>
<P>
And for an <STRONG>Linux a.out</STRONG> platform:</P>
<P>
<CODE>tar xvzf amaya-linux.tar.gz</CODE></P>
<P>
More generally if the distribution is a tar.gz file:</P>
<P>
<CODE>gunzip -c amaya-system.tar.gz | tar xvf -</CODE></P>
<P>
If this is a tar.Z file:</P>
<P>
<CODE>uncompress -c amaya-system.tar.gz | tar xvf -</CODE></P>
<P>
Whatever the method used, this should print around 40 lines of output and
create a new directory called <CODE>Amaya</CODE> populated with a few files
and directories. If not, your distribution file was probably corrupted during
the transfer, please get a new one. Read carefully the COPYRIGHT and README
files.</P>
<H3>Set up the environment and start Amaya</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG> : This has changed for Amaya 0.9. The binary is lauched
directly without an intermediate script shell.</P>
<P>
The file <CODE>Thot/bin/amaya</CODE> is the starting script used to launch
<STRONG>Amaya</STRONG>, the best thing is to add the path to the
Thot/bin/SYSTEM directory to your PATH environment variable. For example on a
<STRONG>Linux-ELF</STRONG> system:</P>
<P>
<CODE>setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/local/Thot/bin/LINUX-ELF</CODE></P>
<P>
for a csh or tcsh shell. When using sh, bash or another variant of the Bourne
shell</P>
<P>
<CODE>PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Thot/bin/LINUX-ELF ; export $PATH</CODE></P>
<P>
Maybe this command should be added to the .login startup script. Once done one
can lauch amaya simply by typing "amaya" to the shell prompt. The
<STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> main window should open and display the first page of
the <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> documentation.</P>
<H3>If something goes wrong and advice</H3>

<UL>
<LI>If <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> doesn't seems to work, verify the few following
points:
<OL>
<LI>the <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> variable is correctly set.
<LI>The binary just installed is the correct one, i.e. it is the correct
binaries for the current machine (don't try to start the Linux-ELF version on
a Solaris machine or an old Linux a.out installation).
<LI>If the binary version is ok, check the availability of the dynamic
libraries needed by the executable file amayamain (located under
<CODE>Thot/bin/SYSTEM/amaya</CODE>). for example on a
<STRONG>Linux-ELF</STRONG> system type
<P>
<CODE>ldd Thot/bin/LINUX-ELF/amaya</CODE></P>
<P>
and check that there is no missing libraries.</P>
</OL>
<LI>One can install packages for different platform under the same directory
(for example on a server filesystem exported via NFS to an heterogenous set of
machines).
<LI>Do not try to put a symbolic link directly to the Thot/bin/amaya script
from /usr/local/bin. The script would not be abble to guess correctly the
value of the internal variable <CODE>THOTDIR</CODE> and the binary would not
start.
<LI>The same apply when trying to copy the script to a different location.
<LI>All the traffic on the Amaya mailing-list is archived <A
href="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/">here</A>. Please have a look
at it before sending us mail if something goes wrong. Remember, it's an Alpha
release.
