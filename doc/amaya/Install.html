<H1>How to install the Amaya Binary Release</H1>

<P>
<IMG src="warning.gif"> In the following, we assume that the path stored in
the archive begins with the <CODE><STRONG>Thot</STRONG></CODE> directory (this
change was introduced for the source distribution). Older binary distributions
use <CODE><STRONG>Amaya</STRONG></CODE> as the top directory name instead.</P>
<H3>Choose a place for Amaya</H3>

<P>
Supposing the binary distribution was loaded fine, one must choose a place to
install it. We suggest</P>
<UL>
<LI>/usr/local for a system wide installation
<LI>the user home directory for a personnal installation
</UL>
<P>
A Linux version doesn't need more that 5 Megabytes of disk space, even a RISC
architecture distribution should not exceed 10 Megabytes.</P>
<H3>Extract the distribution</H3>

<P>
Move the distribution to this directory, check that the rights on this
directory allow you to create a directory and extract the distribution.</P>
<P>
On a <STRONG>Linux ELF</STRONG> platform one must invoke:</P>
<P>
<CODE>tar xvzf amaya-linux-elf-<STRONG>Release</STRONG>.tar.gz</CODE></P>
<P>
Where <STRONG>Release</STRONG> has to be replaced by the current verion
number.</P>
<P>
And for an <STRONG>Linux a.out</STRONG> platform:</P>
<P>
<CODE>tar xvzf amaya-linux-<STRONG>Release</STRONG>.tar.gz</CODE></P>
<P>
More generally if the distribution is a tar.gz file:</P>
<P>
<CODE>gunzip -c
amaya-<STRONG>Platform</STRONG>-<STRONG>Release</STRONG>.tar.gz | tar xvf
-</CODE></P>
<P>
Whatever the method used, this should print around 40 lines of output and
create a new directory called <CODE>Thot</CODE> populated with a few files and
directories. If not, your distribution file was probably corrupted during
transfer, please get a new one. Read carefully the <CODE>COPYRIGHT</CODE>,
<CODE>README</CODE> and <CODE>AboutTho</CODE>t  files.</P>
<H3>Set up the environment and start Amaya</H3>

<P>
The file <CODE>Thot/SYSTEM/bin/amaya</CODE> is the <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG>
binary, the best thing is to add the path to the Thot/SYSTEM/bin directory to
your PATH environment variable. For example on a <STRONG>Linux-ELF</STRONG>
system:</P>
<P>
<CODE>setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/local/Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin</CODE></P>
<P>
for a csh or tcsh shell. When using sh, bash or another variant of the Bourne
shell</P>
<P>
<CODE>PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin ; export $PATH</CODE></P>
<P>
Maybe this command should be added to the .login startup script. Once done one
can lauch <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> simply by typing "amaya" to the shell prompt.
The <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> main window should open and display the first page
of the <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> documentation.</P>
<H3>If something goes wrong</H3>

<UL>
<LI>If <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> doesn't seems to work, check the following
points:
<OL>
<LI>the <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> variable is correctly set.
<LI>The binary just installed is the correct one, i.e. it is the correct
binaries for the current machine (don't try to start the Linux-ELF version on
a Solaris machine or an old Linux a.out installation).
<LI>If the binary version is ok, check the availability of the dynamic
libraries needed by the executable file amayamain (located under
<CODE>Thot/bin/SYSTEM/amaya</CODE>). for example on a
<STRONG>Linux-ELF</STRONG> system type
<P>
<CODE>ldd Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin/amaya</CODE></P>
<P>
and check that there is no missing libraries.</P>
</OL>
<LI>One can install packages for different platform under the same directory
(for example on a server filesystem exported via NFS to an heterogenous set of
machines), use the appropriate <CODE>PATH</CODE> on each platform.
<LI>All the traffic on the Amaya mailing-list is archived <A
href="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/">here</A>. Please have a look
at it before sending us mail if something goes wrong. Remember, it's an Alpha
release.
