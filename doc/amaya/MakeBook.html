<h2><a name="L1065">Assembling large document collections</a></h2>

<p>
Amaya allows you to handle document collections. Such a collection may, for
instance, represent a technical documentation constituted by several web
pages. One of these pages contains the title of the whole documentation (an
<code>H1</code> element), an introduction (some other elements), and a list
(<code>OL</code> or <code>UL</code>) whose items contain links to each
chapter. Chapters are separate documents which can also have the same type of
structure.</p>
<p>
Such an organization is useful for browsing, but it has a number of drawbacks
when the whole documentation has to be printed. <strong>Amaya</strong>
addresses this problem with the "make book" function. You just have to use
typed links for linking chapters: associate a <code>rel=chapter</code> or
<code>rel=subdocument</code> attribute with the anchor that refers to a
chapter (select the <code>A</code> element and use the <strong><a
href="Attributs.html#L1073">Attributes</a></strong>
menu). Then, when activating the "make book" function, all blocks
(<code>LI</code> elements in the above example) containing a typed link to a
chapter will be replaced by the corresponding actual web pages, and you will
get a unique document containing the whole collection. This large document can
then be <a
href="Numbering.html#L1064">numbered</a> and <a
href="Printing.html#L1062">printed</a> with a
complete table of contents and a list of all links.</p>
<p>
To activate this tool, choose the <strong>Make Book</strong> item from the
<strong>Special</strong> menu.</p>
