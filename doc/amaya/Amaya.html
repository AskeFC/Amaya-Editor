<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Amaya is the name of W3C's own test-bed browser/authoring tool and is used
to demonstrate and test many of the new developments in Web protocols and data
formats. Given the very fast moving nature of Web technology, Amaya has a
central role to play. It is versatile and extensible - new features can be
easily added - and is available on both Unix and Windows&nbsp;'95/NT
platforms.</p>

<p>Amaya has a counterpart called <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> which plays a similar role
on the server side.</p>

<p>Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring environment and comes
equipped with a WYSIWYG style of interface, similar to that of the most
popular commercial browsers. With such an interface, users do not need to know
the HTML or CSS languages. Features of Amaya include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Amaya lets users both browse and author Web pages</b>

<p>Using Amaya you can create Web pages and upload them onto a server. Authors
can create a document from scratch, they can browse the web and find the
information they need, copy and paste it to their pages, and create links to
other Web sites. All this is done in a straightforward and simple manner, and
actions are performed in a single consistent environment. Editing and browsing
functions are integrated seamlessly in a single tool.</p>

<p align="left"><img src="Icons/amaya-ui" alt="Screen shot of Amaya's main
view" hspace="10" width="303" height="407"></p>

<p>The image above shows the Amaya main view. Along the top are a number of
buttons associated with editing. At any time, the user can select any part of
a document and assign to it an HTML type (H1, LI, EM, etc.), by means of the
Types menu or of the shortcut buttons. Such a command transforms the selected
part into an element of the chosen type. <br clear="all">
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Amaya maintains a consistent internal document model adhering to the
DTD</b>

<p>Although a WYSIWYG interface is presented to the author, "behind the
scenes" Amaya always represents the document internally in a structured way
consistent with the Document Type Definition (DTD). A properly structured
document enables other tools to further process the data safely.</p>

<p>Amaya allows you to display at the same time as the formatted view the
document structure, which is portrayed diagrammatically on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Amaya is able to work on several documents at a time</b>

<p>Amaya can act as a browser and as an editor simultaneously on several
documents. Authors can follow, create and modify links. The whole Amaya
functionality is available at any time for any document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Amaya helps authors create hypertext links</b>

<p>The editor helps you create and text out links to other documents on the
Web from the document you currently are working on. You can view the links and
get a feel for how the information is interconnected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Amaya is easily extended.</b>

<p>Several APIs and mechanisms are available to change and extend its
functionality with the least modification to the source code. Amaya thus
allows for easy customization by providing a means for extensions to access
Amaya's internal procedures and functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find a more detailed description of Amaya and of its features in
the W3C Note "<a href="../TR/NOTE-amaya-970220.html">An Introduction to
Amaya</a>."</p>

<h3>Transport protocols</h3>

<p>Amaya accesses remote sites by means of HTTP 1.1. Implementation of this
protocol is provided by the W3C <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">libwww</a>. Amaya takes advantage of he most
advanced features of HTTP, such as content negotiation to retrieve the most
appropriate picture format, for instance, keep alive connections to save
bandwidth and authentication to allow secure remote publishing.</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>

<p>Amaya displays images including those in the <a
href="../Graphics/PNG/">PNG</a> format, which is a more powerful graphics
format than GIF and is being increasingly used on the Web.</p>

<p>A CGM plug-in (CGM is commonly used vector graphics format in computer
drawing packages) developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratory was demonstrated
at EITC'97 in Brussells.</p>

<h3>Style Sheets</h3>

<p>Amaya has support for the W3C style sheet language <a
href="../Style/">CSS</a> although this is not yet complete. For simple
properties like foreground and background colors, alignment, etc. the user can
interact on a formatted document whitout manipulating the CSS syntax. At the
same time Amaya  provides an efficient mechanism to test and associate
external style sheets with HTML documents. Users can also download, edit and
publish CSS style sheets as well as HTML pages. </p>

<h3><a name="math">Math on the Web</a></h3>

<p>Amaya demonstrates an implementation of <a
href="../TR/REC-MathML/">MathML</a> which allows users to browse and edit web
pages containing mathematical expressions.  Like the rest of the document,
these expressions are manipulated through a WYSIWYG interface. Amaya uses
namespaces to integrate MathML expressions within  XHTML documents, i.e. HTML
documents written in XML syntax.</p>

<p align="left"><img src="Icons/amaya-math" alt="Screen shot of Amaya's Math"
width="449" height="500" hspace="10"></p>

<p>This screen shot is a demonstration of MathML, an XML application resulting
from work by the W3C Math working group. With Amaya, an author can see the
formatted view and the structure view at the same time. <br clear="all">
</p>

<h4>Printing</h4>

<p>Generation of PostScript files. Amaya offers some facilities like printing
the table of contents of the document.</p>

<h4>API</h4>

<p>The editor offers an API for adding new functions or for modifying existing
functions.This  API written in C is used to experiment with the Java API
developed by the Document Object Model (<a href="/DOM/Activity">DOM</a>)
activity.</p>

<p>The <a href="User/">documentation</a> provided with this release is not
complete yet, but it should be enough to understand how to compile, configure,
and use Amaya. Some documentation is also available for <a
