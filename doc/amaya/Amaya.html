 &nbsp;<a name="L353">Overview</a></h2>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
Amaya is built on top of the <a
href="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/thot/AboutThot.html">Thot</a> library
developed at <a href="http://www.inria.fr/">Inria</a> by project <a
href="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/">Opera</a>. Thot offers a comprehensive
toolset for structured document manipulations.</p>
<p>
Ir&egrave;ne Vatton and Vincent Quint started developing a HTML editor at
Inria in October 1994 in order to evaluate the advantages of structured
editing for authoring Web documents. This first prototype was then known as
Tamaya. In October 1995, Daniel Veillard joined the team for implementing the
new CSS proposal. The first demo of Tamaya was presented at the WWW4
Conference, in Boston. In February 1996, the team joined the W3C for
developing <strong> Amaya</strong>, the W3C's testbed client software, based
on this background.</p>

<h4>Status</h4>
<p>
Still under development. The first public demo of <strong>Amaya</strong> took
place during the <a href="http://www5conf.inria.fr">Fifth International WWW
Conference</a>, in Paris (May 6-10, 1996). Source code for the current version
is available for downloading.</p>

<h4>Platforms</h4>
<p>
We have succesfully compiled the source code of <b>Amaya</b> on various <a
href="User/Platforms.html">Unix platforms</a> and on PC/Windows.</p>
