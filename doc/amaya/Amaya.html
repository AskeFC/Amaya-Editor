<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Amaya is the name of W3C's own test-bed browser/authoring tool and is used to
demonstrate and test many of the new developments in Web protocols and data
formats. Given the very fast moving nature of Web technology, Amaya has a
central role to play. It is versatile and extensible - new features can be
easily added - and is available on both Unix and Windows&nbsp;'95/NT
platforms.</p>
<p>
Amaya has a counterpart called <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> which plays a similar role
on the server side.</p>
<p>
Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring environment and comes equipped
with a WYSIWYG style of interface, similar to that of the most popular
commercial browsers. With such an interface, users do not need to know the
HTML or CSS languages. Features of Amaya include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Amaya lets users both browse and author Web pages</b>
<p>
Using Amaya you can create Web pages and upload them onto a server. Authors
can create a document from scratch, they can browse the web and find the
information they need, copy and paste it to their pages, and create links to
other Web sites. All this is done in a straightforward and simple manner, and
actions are performed in a single consistent environment. Editing and browsing
functions are integrated seamlessly in a single tool.</p>
<p>
<img src="Icons/amaya-ui.gif" alt="Screen shot of Amaya's main view"
align=right hspace="10" width="303" height="407"></p>
<p>
The image above shows the Amaya main view. Along the top are a number of
buttons associated with editing. At any time, the user can select any part of
a document and assign to it an HTML type (H1, LI, EM, etc.), by means of the
Types menu or of the shortcut buttons. Such a command transforms the selected
part into an element of the chosen type. <br clear=all>
</p>
<li>
<b>Amaya maintains a consistent internal document model adhering to the
DTD</b>
<p>
Although a WYSIWYG interface is presented to the author, "behind the scenes"
Amaya always represents the document internally in a structured way consistent
with the Document Type Definition (DTD). A properly structured document
enables other tools to further process the data safely.</p>
<p>
Amaya allows you to display at the same time as the formatted view the
document structure, which is portrayed diagrammatically on the screen.</p>
<li>
<b>Amaya is able to work on several documents at a time</b>
<p>
Amaya can act as a browser and as an editor simultaneously on several
documents. Authors can follow, create and modify links. The whole Amaya
functionality is available at any time for any document.</p>
<li>
<b>Amaya helps authors create hypertext links</b>
<p>
The editor helps you create and text out links to other documents on the Web
from the document you currently are working on. You can view the links and get
a feel for how the information is interconnected.</p>
<li>
<b>Amaya is easily extended.</b>
<p>
Several APIs and mechanisms are available to change and extend its
functionality with the least modification to the source code. Amaya thus
allows for easy customization by providing a means for extensions to access
Amaya's internal procedures and functions.</p>
</ul>
<p>
You can find a more detailed description of Amaya and of its features in the
W3C Note "<a href="../TR/NOTE-amaya-970220.html">An Introduction to
Amaya</a>."</p>

<h3>Transport protocols</h3>
<p>
Amaya accesses remote sites by means of HTTP 1.1. Two different
implementations of this protocol can be used: <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">libwww</a> or the Java classes from
<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a>. Amaya takes advantage
of the most advanced features of HTTP, such as content negotiation to retrieve
the most appropriate picture format, for instance, or keep alive connections
to save bandwidth.</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>
Amaya displays images including those in the <a
href="../Graphics/PNG/">PNG</a> format, which is a more powerful graphics
format than GIF and is being increasingly used on the Web.</p>
<p>
A CGM plug-in (CGM is commonly used vector graphics format in computer drawing
packages) developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratory was demonstrated at
EITC'97 in Brussells.</p>

<h3>Support for CSS</h3>
<p>
Amaya has support for <a href="../Style/">CSS1</a> although this is not yet
complete. The user interacts on a formatted document and does need to see the
CSS syntax. The current implementation should be considered as an experiment
but the plan is to revisit this part of the Amaya code and improve it to
provide a stronger basis for implementing CSS2.</p>

<h3>Demonstration of MathML</h3>
<p>
Amaya now demonstrates a prototype implementation of <a
href="../TR/WD-math/">MathML</a> which allows users to browse and edit web
pages containing mathematical expressions.  Like the rest of the document,
these expressions are manipulated through a WYSIWYG interface.</p>
<p>
<img src="Icons/amaya-math.gif" alt="Screen shot of Amaya's Math" align=right
width="449" height="500" hspace="10"></p>
<p>
This is a demonstration of MathML, an XML application resulting from work by
the HTML-Math working group. MathML allows authors to format equations for
publishing on the World Wide Web. The user can see the formatted view and the
structure view at the same time. <br clear=all>
</p>

<h4>Printing</h4>
<p>
Generation of PostScript files. Amaya offers some facilities like printing the
table of contents of the document.</p>

<h4>API</h4>
<p>
The editor offers an API for adding new functions or for modifying existing
functions.This API is available in two flavors: C and Java.</p>

 </a>&nbsp;<a name="L360">User Documentation and Design Overview</a></h2>
<p>
The <a href="User/">documentation</a> provided with this release is not
complete yet, but it should be enough to understand how to compile, configure,
and use Amaya. Some documentation is also available for <a
href="User/Overview.html#L113">developers</a>.</p>

 </a>&nbsp;<a name="L362">Mailing list</a></h2>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> has the following mailing list that you are more than
welcome to use! Before you send mail to the list, please check out the
archives - they often contain good information about how to solve problems.
Please do not send mail directly to the authors - the mail load is already
rather high and you will most probably get a better response time by using the
following mailing list.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>www-amaya@w3.org</b></dt>
<dd>
A public mailing list for an open discussion of ideas, diffs, new features,
bugs, etc. An <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/">
