<h2>Creating new elements</h2>

<h3><a name="New">New documents</a></h3>

<p>Amaya allows you to create new local or distant documents. Three types of
document are available : <a href="#Creating">XHTML</a>, <a
href="Math.html#Math">MathML</a> or <a href="SVG.html">SVG.</a></p>

<p>To create a document, choose the <strong>New</strong> option in the
<strong>File</strong> menu and select the appropriate type. Then, specify the
URI or the local name of the new document (a default name is assigned to the
document if no name is specified). After confirmation, Amaya opens a new
window with the specified document. If this document already exists, Amaya
loads its current version otherwise. a new document with the corresponding
root element is created.</p>

<h3><a name="Types">Buttons and types</a> menu</h3>

<p>The simplest way to create new elements in a document is to move the
insertion point to the desired position and to use the <strong>Types</strong>
menu or the buttons corresponding to the most common elements (image,
headings, lists, etc.). These buttons and menu items create the corresponding
element at the current position.</p>

<p>In some cases, the desired element cannot be created exactly at the
position chosen, because of the constraints imposed by the HTML DTD.
<strong>Amaya</strong> then tries to create the element at the closest
position where it is allowed. For instance, if the insertion point is at the
end of the last line of a paragraph when you click on the <img
src="../Icons/H2.gif" alt="H2" /> button, <strong>Amaya</strong> does not
create the new heading at that particular position (which would be invalid),
but after the paragraph (which is probably what you intended).</p>

<p>In some other cases, <strong>Amaya</strong> changes the existing structure
for creating the desired element. If the insertion point is somewhere within
a list item (<code>LI</code>) when you create a second level heading (for
example with the <img src="../Icons/H2.gif" alt="H2" /> button, or from the
menu), the list item and its enclosing list are automatically split, in order
to create the requested heading at the chosen position and to comply with the
HTML DTD.</p>

<p>When creating new elements, it is important to select an <em>insertion
point</em>, not some text nor a single character: if the current selection is
not empty, <strong>Amaya</strong> tries to <a
href="Changing.html#L631"><em>transform</em></a> the selected part into the
element type chosen.</p>

<p>Some documentation of <a href="HTML-elements/infoTypes.html">how to use
element types</a> is available, as well as a briefly annotated <a
href="HTML.html">list of all the HTML 4.0 elements</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Structure">Structure menu</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="#Types"><strong>Types</strong> menu</a> allows you to create
only elements that are part of the document <code>BODY</code>. To create
elements in the document <code>HEAD</code>, use the
<strong>Structure</strong> menu from the <a
href="Views.html#Structure">Structure view</a>. This menu works in the same
way as the <strong>Types</strong> menu: put the caret at the desired position
and choose the element type from the <strong>Structure</strong> menu.</p>

<p>The <strong>Structure</strong> menu also allows you to create comments,
using its <strong>Comment</strong> entry. Comments are shown only in the <a
href="Views.html#Structure">Structure view</a>, but they can be inserted at
any position in the document.</p>

<h4>Generated elements</h4>

<p>Some HTML elements are constituted by several other elements of different
types. For instance, a table contains usually a caption
(<code>CAPTION</code>) and several rows (<code>TR</code>) and several cells
(<code>TD</code> or <code>TH</code>) in each row.</p>

<p>When <strong>Amaya</strong> creates such elements, it also creates their
components. A table is created with a caption and a row containing a single
cell. The insertion point is placed automatically in the first of these
components. You can enter the content of that component immediately or later.
You can move to the next (empty) component with the mouse or with the arrow
keys.</p>

<h3><a name="L906">The Enter (or Return) key</a></h3>

<p>When you are writing a new document or a new part in a document, you often
create elements sequentially. To do that, just press the Enter (or Return)
key. The current element is terminated and a new one is created just after.
This applies obviously to paragraphs, but also to other types of elements,
such as headings or <a href="Tables.html#Editing">table cells</a> for
instance.</p>

<p>Most often, the new element created is simply a paragraph, whatever the
type of the previous element. If you need another element type, you can
immediately change the type of that element, by selecting the desired type in
the <strong>Types</strong> menu or by clicking on the corresponding button,
but you can also keep typing and <a href="Changing.html#L653">change the
type</a> later.</p>

<h4 id="multi-enter">Multiple Enters at the end of an element</h4>

<p>When the insertion point is in an empty element, pressing the Enter key
<em>replaces</em> that element by another empty element at the next higher
level in the document structure. This feature allows you to create complex
nested structures very quickly.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following structure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first item in the highest level list. 
    <p>A paragraph in the first item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The second item. 
    <ol type="a">
      <li>First item in the nested list.</li>
      <li>Second item in the nested list.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Last item in the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>To create that structure, create first a numbered list with a first item
(for example by clicking on the <img alt="Numbered List "
src="../Icons/NumList.gif" /> button) and type in the first line. At the end
of that first line, press the Enter key: it creates a new paragraph in the
item. At the end of this paragraph, press the Enter key: it creates yet
another paragraph, but pressing the same key again replaces that paragraph by
an empty item 2. At the end of the first line of item 2, create a new list
with its first item (for example click on the <img alt="Numbered List "
src="../Icons/NumList.gif" /> button). The new list will automatically be
nested. Item b. is created by a double Enter at the end of item a. When the
insertion point is at the end of item b, create item 3 by four successive
Enters. To create the paragraph that follows these lists, press Enter three
times when the insertion point is at the end of item 3.</p>

<h4 id="multi-enter2">Multiple Enters at the beginning of an element</h4>

<p>The Enter key works in the same way when the insertion point is at the
beginning of an element, but it creates new elements <em>before</em> the
current element.</p>

<p>For instance, you can add an initial paragraph in a list item by moving
the insertion point before the first character of that item and pressing
Enter. If you press Enter twice, you get a new item before the current item.
This is useful for inserting a new item before the first one.</p>

<p>This use of the Enter key does not apply only to lists and paragraphs, but
to all elements. It is for instance very convenient for <a
href="Manual.html">creating tables</a>.</p>

<h4 id="end-anchor">Exiting anchors or styled character strings</h4>

<p>When a paragraph or another block of text is styled - terminated by an
anchor or a character string in bold, italic or other such style - moving the
insertion point to the end and typing appends characters to the anchor or the
styled string. If you want to exit this styled element and enter plain text,
just press <code>Enter</code> to exit from the anchor or styled element, and
type.</p>

<p>When a paragraph or another block of text is styled - starts with an
anchor or a styled character string - moving the insertion point to the
beginning and typing inserts characters into the anchor or the styled string.
If you want to insert before this styled element and enter plain text, just
press Enter to exit from the anchor or styled element, and type.</p>

<h4 id="edit-dl">Editing definition lists (dl/dt/dd)</h4>

<p>The Enter key is also useful for editing definitions lists. Consider the
following example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>Term1</dt>
    <dt>Term2</dt>
      <dd>Definition of both terms.</dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a definition list (<code>dl</code>) containing two terms
(<code>dt</code>) followed by a definition (<code>dd</code>). To add a new
paragraph within the definition (<code>dd</code>), put the caret at the end
(after word "terms") and hit the Enter key. If you hit Enter twice, you exit
from the current definition (<code>dd</code>) and you create a new term
(<code>dt</code>). At the end of that new term, pressing Enter once allows
you to create another new term (<code>dt</code>). Pressing Enter twice
creates a new definition (<code>dd</code>) instead.</p>

<p>If you want to create a new term and its definition <em>before</em> Term1,
put the caret at the beginning of "Term1" and press Enter. Type the new term
(<code>dt</code>). Then press Enter twice: a new definition (<code>dd</code>)
is created right after the new term.</p>

<h3><a name="Changing">Changing the document Title</a></h3>

<p>You can edit the document title (TITLE element) in with the menu entry
<strong>Types/Change Title</strong>. You can also edit the document title in
the <a href="Views.html#Structure">structure view</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="WhiteSpace">
<h3>White-space handling</h3>

<p>For the XHTML, <a href="Math.html#Math">MathML</a>, <a
href="SVG.html">SVG</a> documents as well as for MathML or SVG elements
included into a HTML document, Amaya removes the <strong>insignificant
white-space characters</strong> when it loads a document unless they must be
explicitly preserved.</p>

<p>Are considered as insignificant white-space characters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the end of line characters (#xD et (#xA),</li>
  <li>the tabs characters (#X9),</li>
  <li>the leading spaces of an element,</li>
  <li>the trailing spaces of an element,</li>
  <li>the contiguous spaces (in that case, one space is preserved).</li>
</ul>

<p>If an author wants to preserve all the characters for some elements, he
can use the <code>xml:space</code> attribute or the element <code>PRE</code>
(that element is only valid for XHTML documents). The only possible values
for that attribute are "<code>default</code>" and "<code>preserve</code>".
The value "<code>default</code>" signals that applications' default
white-space treatments are acceptable for these elements. In Amaya, the
default treatment removes the insignificant white-space characters for all
supported DTD (see above). The value "<code>preserve</code>" indicates the
intent that applications preserve all the characters, except the first one
that immediately follows the end tag of the element where it is specified if
that element is an end of line. The <code>xml:space</code> attribute is
applied to all elements within the content of the element where it is
specified, unless overriden with another instance of the
<code>xml:space</code> attribute. Concerning the XHTML DTD, the element
<code>PRE</code> causes the same behaviour that the <code>xml:space</code>
attribute with the value "<code>preserve</code>".</p>

<p>Amaya applies the white space handling when it loads a document, not when
we are editing it. A consequence is that if you type insignificant
white-space characters, its will be visible and saved but will be removed at
the next loading. For example, the following source code:</p>

<p><code>&lt;p&gt;Amaya removes the&lt;strong&gt; insignificant white-space
&lt;/strong&gt;when it loads ...&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

<p>gives during edition:</p>
<pre>Amaya removes the<strong> insignificant white-space </strong>when it loads...</pre>

<p>and will be saved with that syntax. At the next loading of the document,
this code will give:</p>

<p><code>Amaya removes the</code><strong><code>insignificant
white-space</code></strong><code>when it loads...</code></p>

<p>because the leading space and the trailing space of the element
<code>strong</code> are considered as insignificant and are removed.</p>

<p>The correct source code would be:</p>

<p><code>&lt;p&gt;Amaya removes the &lt;strong&gt;insignificant
white-space&lt;/strong&gt; when it loads ...&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
