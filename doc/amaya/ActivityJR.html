<blockquote>

<a href="/Consortium/Activities">Activity statements</a> provide a managerial
overview of W3C's work in this area. They are designed to be read from
beginning to end, to be informative and interesting. The role of W3C is given,
also the benefits to the Web community, accomplishments to date and a summary
of what the future holds. Background reading pages to help set the scene and
explain any technical concepts are in preparation. Where necessary these also
contain a short tutorial.

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Amaya is W3C's own versatile editor/browser. With the extremely fast moving
nature of Web technology, Amaya plays a central role at the Consortium. Easily
extended to integrate new ideas into its design, Amaya provides developers
with many specialized features including multiple views, where the internal
structural model of the document can be displayed alongside the browser's view
of how it should be presented on the screen. Amaya has a counterpart called <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> which plays a similar role
on the server side. Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring environment
and comes equipped with a WYSIWYG style of interface, similar to that of the
more popular commercial browsers.</p>

<p>Amaya maintains a consistent internal document model adhering to the
Document Type Definition (DTD), meaning that it handles the relationships
between various document components: paragraphs, headings, lists and so on, as
laid down in the relevant W3C HTML Recommendation. Amaya has been extended to
demonstrate many features in HTML 4.0, the current recommendation for the
language.</p>

<h2><a name="role">Amaya at W3C</a></h2>

<p>Amaya has been developed at W3C by the Amaya team: Ir&egrave;ne Vatton,
Ramzi Gu&eacute;tari, Jos&eacute; Kahan, Vincent Quint, Daniel Veillard. Used
by other groups within the consortium to demonstrate work and to act as an
experimental platform Amaya has played an important role in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Math on the Web:</b> Amaya demonstrates an implementation of <a
href="../TR/WD-math/">MathML</a> which allows users to browse and edit web
pages containing mathematical expressions. The screen below shows the way that
you can display equations on the screen side by side the MathML model used by
Amaya.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><img width="350" height="400" src="amaya-math.gif" alt="Amaya screen with
equations"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>HTTP protocol:</b> In its basic version, Amaya implements many web
protocols and formats: it accesses remote sites by means of HTTP 1.1, as
implemented in <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">libwww</a>. Amaya
takes advantage of the most advanced features of HTTP, such as content
negotiation to retrieve, for instance, the most appropriate picture format,
keep alive connections to save bandwidth and authentication to allow secured
remote publishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Graphics:</b> Amaya displays images in the PNG format, which is a more
powerful graphics format than GIF and more suited to the needs of the Web. A
CGM plug-in developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratories was first
demonstrated at EITC'97 in Brussels and in many other events. We made an
experimental implementation of Scalable Vector Graphics (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a>) in Amaya. The graphics are
written in XML and may be mixed freely with HTML and with MathML. CSS style
sheets may be used to alter the look of the graphics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Style sheets:</b> Amaya has extensive support for the W3C style sheet
language CSS and offers a simple-to-use interface enabling users to write
style sheets for Web documents without having to know the details of the
syntax associated with style sheet rules and properties. You can create
colored text, change the font, set the background color and control other
presentational effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>HTML 4:</b> As an editor, Amaya is guaranteed to produce HTML 4
compliant code. The way it handles documents is strictly according to the HTML
DTD, the Document Type Definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>DOM:</b> Amaya is used to experiment with the Java API developed by the
Document Object Model (<a href="/DOM/Activity">DOM</a>) activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Amaya in other languages:</b> It is now possible to launch Amaya so that
the user dialogs are in German or French. The intention is to cover other
languages in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="current">Current Situation</a></h2>

<p>The Amaya software is available for both Windows and Unix platforms and can
be <a href="Overview.html#L347">downloaded</a> from the W3C site. It is
available both in <a href="User/SourceDist.html">source code</a> and in <a
href="User/BinDist.html">ready to use</a> forms. The new version 2.0 of Amaya
is available since the end of April. This new version of Amaya has a number of
new features including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>A secured authentication protocol</em>: This protocol, called message
digest authentication (see HTTP/1.1 specification), avoids sending a user's
password in an unencrypted form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The lost update checking</em>: Amaya is able to enter into dialog with
the server (Apache and Jigsaw) to notify the user when pages they want to
publish have been updated by another user. This can be seen as the first step
toward a cooperative authoring tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>XHTML support</em>: Amaya is able to generate XHTML documents according
to the latest draft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>New CSS features</em>: With Amaya, users can download, edit and publish
CSS files as well as HTML pages. Amaya also provides menu entries to link and
to unlink external style sheets to/from HTML documents.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Documentation is provided at every level, catering for the beginner right
through to the developer wanting to extend the software for their own
purposes. There is also an active and very useful mailing list where users can
discuss Amaya features and how they work, making note of any problems
experienced using the software.</p>

<p>The publicly released version is written in C. There is also a version with
Java support, not publicly available at the moment. This experimental version
embeds a Java virtual machine and uses the HTTP classes from Jigsaw, the
object-oriented server for HTTP 1.1 written in Java and provides a DOM Java
API.</p>

<p>Amaya CVS base is now publicly available at http://dev.w3.org. It has world
read-only access. Depending on the response and on the quality of
contributions, we may open a write access to other people afterwards.</p>

<h2><a name="future">What the Future Holds</a></h2>

<p>Beyond this, the Amaya team will be working on:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>
a fuller implementation of CSS2 properties,
</li>
<li>
features to support internationalization and localization for a limited set of
countries,
</li>
<li>
experimentations with XML documents,
</li>
<li>
integration with the GTK (GIMP Toolkit) to allow easier external
experimentations and contributions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The team will continue to work with other W3C activities to help
demonstrate and test new developments in a variety of areas.</p>
