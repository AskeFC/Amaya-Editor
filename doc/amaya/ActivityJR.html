<h1>Amaya Browser/Editor Activity</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Amaya is the name of W3C's own test-bed browser/authoring tool and is used to
demonstrate and test many of the new developments in Web protocols and data
formats. Given the very fast moving nature of Web technology, Amaya has a
central role to play. It is versatile and extensible - new features can be
easily added - and is available on both Unix and Windows&nbsp;'95/NT
platforms.</p>
<p>
Amaya has a counterpart called <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> which plays a similar role
on the server side.</p>
<p>
Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring environment and comes equiped
with a WYSIWYG style of interface, similar to that of the most popular
commercial browsers. With such an interface, users do not need to know the
HTML or CSS languages. Features of Amaya include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Amaya lets users both browse and author Web pages</b>
<p>
Using Amaya you can create Web pages and upload them onto a server. Authors
can create a document from scratch, they can browse the web and find the
information they need, copy and paste it to their pages, and create links to
other Web sites. All this is done in a straightforward and simple manner, and
actions are performed in a single consistent environment. Editing and browsing
functions are integrated seamlessly in a single tool.</p>
<p>

Amaya's main view" align=right hspace="10" width="303" height="407"></p>
<p>
The image above shows the Amaya main view. Along the top are a number of
buttons associated with editing. At any time, the user can select any part of
a document and assign to it an HTML type (H1, LI, EM, etc.), by means of the
Types menu or of the shortcut buttons. Such a command transforms the selected
part into an element of the chosen type. <br clear=all>
</p>
<li>
<b>Amaya maintains a consistent internal document model adhering to the
DTD</b>
<p>
Although a WYSIWYG interface is presented to the author, "behind the scenes"
Amaya always represents the document internally in a structured way consistent
with the Document Type Defintion (DTD). A properly structured document enables
other tools to further process the data safely.</p>
<p>
Amaya allows you to display at the same time as the formatted view the
document structure, which is portrayed diagrammatically on the screen.</p>
<li>
<b>Amaya is able to work on several documents at a time</b>
<p>
Amaya can act as a browser and as an editor simultaneously on several
documents. Authors can follow, create and modify links. The whole Amaya
functionality is available at any time for any document.</p>
<li>
<b>Amaya helps authors create hypertext links</b>
<p>
The editor helps you create and text out links to other documents on the Web
from the document you currently are working on. You can view the links and get
a feel for how the information is interconnected.</p>
<li>
<b>Amaya is easily extended.</b>
<p>
Several APIs and mechanisms are available to change and extend its
functionality with the least modification to the source code. Amaya thus
allows for easy customization by providing a means for extensions to access
Amaya's internal procedures and functions.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Web protocols and formats</h2>
<p>
In its basic version, Amaya implements many web protocols and formats:</p>

<h3>Support for HTML 4</h3>
<p>
Amaya has been extended to demonstrate many features in HTML 4.0, the current
recommendation for the language:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Amaya now supports the OBJECT element with a general mechanism for the
insertion of multimedia objects and a wide range of other media plug-ins.
<li>
The SPAN element is also supported, used to attach style or language to inline
elements.
<li>
Implementation of the HTML 4.0 tables model should be complete by January.
<li>
The LANG attribute (with multilingual hyphenation and spell checking), ID (for
CSS and links) - CLASS (for CSS) have all been implemented
</ul>

<h3>Transport protocols </h3>
<p>
Amaya accesses remote sites by means of HTTP 1.1. Two different
implementations of this protocol can be used: <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">libwww</a> or the Java classes from
<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a>. Amaya takes advantage
of the most advanced features of HTTP, such as content negotiation to retrieve
the most appropriate picture format, for instance, or keep alive connections
to save bandwidth.</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>
Amaya displays images including those in the PNG format, which is a more
powerful graphics format than GIF and is being increasingly used on the
Web.</p>
<p>
A CGM plug-in (CGM is commonly used vector graphics format in computer drawing
packages) developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratory was demonstrated at
EITC'97 in Brussells.</p>

<h3>Support for CSS</h3>
<p>
Amaya has support for CSS1 although this is not yet complete. The user
interacts on a formatted document and does need to see the CSS syntax. The
current implementation should be considered as an experiment but the plan is
to revisit this part of the Amaya code and improve it to provide a stronger
basis for implementing CSS2.</p>

<h3>Demonstration of MathML</h3>
<p>
Amaya now demonstrates a prototype implementation of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Team/9712/TR/WD-math/">MathML</a> which allows users
to browse and edit web pages containing mathematical expressions.  Like the
rest of the document, these expressions are manipulated through a WYSIWYG
interface.</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.w3.org/Team/9712/Jenny/amaya-math.gif" alt="Screen shot
of Amaya's Math" align=right width="449" height="500" hspace="10"></p>
<p>
This is a demonstration of MathML, an XML application resulting from work by
the HTML-Math working group. MathML allows authors to format equations for
publishing on the World Wide Web. The user can see the formatted view and the
structure view at the same time. <br clear=all>
</p>

<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Team/9712/Jenny/User/BinDist.html">binary
version</a> of Amaya was first released to W3C members and to the public in
July and August 1996, respectively. The Windows version, first released in
July 1997,  is much more stable now, but it is still missing a few features,
such as printing documents and image map editing. We are working on these
features, which should be available by end of January 1998. The Unix and
Windows versions will then support exactly the same features. Since February
1997, the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Team/9712/Jenny/User/SourceDist.html">source code</a>
has been available to the public.</p>
<p>
We have two distributions of Amaya. A pure C version based on Libwww and a
version embedding a Java virtual machine. The later uses the HTTP classes from
Jigsaw.</p>
<p>
The Amaya API is also available from the Java language offering an easy
customization path for Amaya users.</p>

<h2>What the future holds</h2>
<p>
During the next months, we plan to develop <strong>Amaya</strong> in the
following directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
CSS: improvements to the current implementation and extensions
<li>
XML: extension of the current MathML implementation and support for other XML
applications
<li>
DOM: demonstration of DOM Level 1 in Amaya
<li>
I18N: at least support for western languages. Eastern languages will take more
time.
<li>
HTTP-NG: an experiment is in progress in the Architecture domain to use ILU (a
remote proecedure call framework developed by Xerox PARC).
<li>
WAI: we propose to integrate WAI recommendations in Amaya
</ul>
