<h2><a name="L1052">Saving and publishing documents</a></h2>
<p>
Amaya allows you to save documents either in HTML or as text.</p>

<h3><a name="L1104">Saving documents in HTML</a></h3>
<p>
Currently <b>Amaya</b> does not offer a complete publishing solution, as there
is no support for managing links between different HTML pages located on the
same server. <b>Amaya</b> neither provide any global view of the set of pages
installed on a server. However it is possible to configure the action of
saving files to a remote server. Remote saving can be accessed in two way,
through the <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>SaveAs</strong> commands.</p>

<h4><a name="L1517">The Save command</a></h4>
<p>
The save command can be invoked either by choosing <strong>Save</strong> from
the <strong>File</strong> menu or by clicking on the <img src="../Icons/floppy.gif"
align=middle border="0"> button. This command saves the current document to
the location it was fetched from. Newly added images are saved in the same
directory and no confirmation is asked. If one need to save newly added images
to a different location, the <strong>Save As</strong> command should be used
instead.</p>

<h4><a name="L1518">The Save As command</a></h4>
<p>
Selecting the <strong>Save As</strong> entry in the <strong>File</strong> menu
opens a dialog box that allows you to save the current document to a different
location, a remote Web server or the local file system. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
save the document to a local disk, 
<li>
save the document to a remote URL, 
<li>
copy images embedded in the document, 
<li>
transform embedded URLs to asbolute one, 
<li>
save images to a different location. 
</ul>
<p>
Notice that for saving a document to a remote URL, you must have the right to
execute a PUT method on the remote machine. The WWW server has to be
explicitely configured to accept input from your machine or some
authentification mecanism will be involved. See the page on <a
href="Put.html">configuring your server to accept the PUT</a> method or ask
your Web administrator to do so.</p>
<p>
For more details, see the document <a href="Publishing.html">Publishing in
Amaya</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="L1105">Saving documents as text</a></h3>
<p>
The <strong>Save As</strong> command from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu
displays a dialog box that allows you to save the current document in various
formats. Clicking the <strong>Text</strong> button from the <strong>Output
Format</strong> menu saves the document in text form, in a local file. A list
of all URLs used in the document is appended to that file.</p>
