<h1>How to install the Amaya-Java Binary Release</h1>
<p>
In the following, we assume that the path stored in the archive begins with
the <code><strong>Thot</strong></code> directory . Currently the binary
release is availabble only for a limited </p>

<h3>Choose a place for Amaya-Java</h3>
<p>
Supposing the binary distribution was loaded fine, one must choose a place to
install it. We suggest</p>
<ul>
<li>
/usr/local for a system wide installation
<li>
the user home directory for a personnal installation
</ul>
<p>
An <strong>Amaya-Java</strong> binary distribution uses around 20 Megabytes of
disk space, the <code>Thot/classes/classes.zip</code> file being responsible
for half of the disk usage..</p>

<h3>Extract the distribution</h3>
<p>
Move the distribution to this directory, check that the rights on this
directory allow you to create a directory and extract the distribution.</p>
<p>
On a <strong>Linux i386</strong> platform one must invoke:</p>
<p>
<code>tar xvzf amaya-java-LINUX-<strong>Release</strong>.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>
Where <strong>Release</strong> has to be replaced by the current verion
number.</p>
<p>
More generally if the distribution is a tar.gz file:</p>
<p>
<code>gunzip -c
amaya-java-<strong>Platform</strong>-<strong>Release</strong>.tar.gz | tar xvf
-</code></p>
<p>
Whatever the method used, this should print list the files extracted and
create a new directory called <code>Thot</code> populated with a few files and
directories. If not, your distribution file was probably corrupted during
transfer, please get a new one. Read carefully the <code>Thot/amaya/COPYRIGHT
</code>file.</p>

<h3>Set up the environment and start Amaya</h3>
<p>
The file <code>Thot/SYSTEM/bin/amaya</code> is the <strong>Amaya-Java</strong>
binary, the best thing is to add the path to the Thot/SYSTEM/bin directory to
your PATH environment variable. For example on a <strong>Linux i386</strong>
system:</p>
<p>
<code>setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/local/Thot/LINUX/bin</code></p>
<p>
for a csh or tcsh shell. When using sh, bash or another variant of the Bourne
shell</p>
<p>
<code>PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Thot/LINUX/bin ; export PATH</code></p>
<p>
Maybe this command should be added to the .login startup script. Once done one
can lauch <strong>Amaya-Java</strong> simply by typing "amaya" to the shell
prompt. The <strong>Amaya-Java</strong> main window should open and display
the first page of the <strong>Amaya-Java</strong> documentation.</p>
<p>
The classes used by <strong>Amaya-Java</strong> are stored in the
<code>Thot/classes</code> directory. You don't need to add these to your
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment, this is done automatically when starting
the Java engine. The sources for the java classes are available in the
<code>Thot/classes/sources.zip </code> ZIP file.</p>

<h3>If something goes wrong</h3>
<ul>
<li>
If <strong>Amaya</strong> doesn't seems to work, check the following points:
<ol>
<li>
the <code>DISPLAY</code> variable is correctly set.
<li>
the Thot/classes/ directory contains valid ZIP files
<li>
eventually remove your previous registry file $HOME/.thotrc.
<li>
The binary just installed is the correct one, i.e. it is the correct binaries
for the current machine (don't try to start the Linux-ELF version on a Solaris
machine or an old Linux a.out installation).
<li>
If the binary version is ok, check the availability of the dynamic libraries
needed by the executable file amayamain (located under
<code>Thot/bin/SYSTEM/amaya</code>). for example on a
<strong>Linux-ELF</strong> system type
<p>
<code>ldd Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin/amaya</code></p>
<p>
and check that there is no missing libraries.</p>
<li>
to debug network problems set
<p>
<code>DEBUG_JAVA_NET=yes</code></p>
<p>
in the registry file <code>$HOME/.thotrc</code> under the <code>[amaya]</code>
section.</p>
</ol>
<li>
One can install packages for different platform under the same directory (for
example on a server filesystem exported via NFS to an heterogenous set of
machines), use the appropriate <code>PATH</code> on each platform.
<li>
All the traffic on the Amaya mailing-list is archived <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/">here</a>. Please have a
look at it before sending us <a href="mailto:www-amaya@w3.org">mail</a> if
something goes wrong. Remember, it's an Alpha release.
