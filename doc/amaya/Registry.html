<H1>The Amaya Registry</H1>
<P>Since version 0.9 beta of Amaya, all the settings allowing the
configuration of <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> are stored in a small database called
<STRONG>registry</STRONG>. It's syntax is highly similar to the
<CODE>WIN.INI</CODE> file found on most PC setup.</P>
<P>This database is splitted onto 2 different files, one for system wide
setting, which should not be modified by users, and a user specific one. Both
files are called thot.ini, the system one is stored in the
<CODE>Thot/bin</CODE> directory (e.g. is <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> has been
installed in <CODE>/usr/local/Amaya</CODE> , the system-wide registry should
be found in <CODE>/usr/local/Thot/config/thot.ini</CODE>). The user specific
one is stored in the home directory of the user, and will be created
automatically if it does not exist at <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> startup.</P>
<P>Here is an example of the system-wide thot.ini, it defines where the main
ressources needed by amaya and the Thot library are located. It also defines
the print command to be used on this system.</P>
<PRE>[system]

[thot_lib]
THOTSCH=$(THOTDIR)/schemas:$(THOTDIR)/amaya
THOTFONT=$(THOTDIR)/fonts
THOTCONFIG= DICOPAR=$(THOTDIR)/dicopar
THOTDOC=$(THOTDIR)/doc
; THOTPRINT=lp -c -dprintername -nnbex -trealname
; THOTPRINT=lpr -Pprintername -#nbex -Trealname
THOTPRINT=lpr

[amaya]
THOTSCH=$(THOTDIR)/amaya
LANG=en_US</PRE>
<P>Each application has it's own section defined by it's name between
brackets.Each section contains the variable definition specific to this
application. The section <CODE>[thot_lib]</CODE> is common to all applications
using the Thot library and the <CODE>[system]</CODE> section contains
variables wich cannot be overwritten by the user's registry. The format
is:</P>
<P><CODE>variable=value up to the end of the line</CODE></P>
<P>Lines beginning by semicolumns are comments. THOTDIR is an internal
variable specifying the location of the <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG> installation (
<CODE>/usr/local/Amaya</CODE> in the previous example). An existing variable
can be used to compute a new one by using the $(variable name) construct.</P>
<P>The system thot.ini file is not expected to be changed by users of Amaya,
however, each user has it's own thot.ini file (automatically created if not
present), where the user can modify the defaults settings like the user
interface language, colors or the home page to load on start-up.</P>
