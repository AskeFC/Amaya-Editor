<h1>Compiling Amaya On Windows NT</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">
This is the first alpha release of Amaya running on Windows NT. We cannot
guarantee that it runs correctly under Windows 95. It was developed with
MSVC++. The project workspace is completely different than the Makefile
delivered for Unix platforms. For example, we cannot run the compilers app,
str, prs from the project workspace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
At the present time, different components of Amaya project workspace are
compiled independently . These components are: libwww, the Thot library,
libjpeg, libpng (with libz) and the Amaya application. Libwww and Thot library
are not yet sub-projects of Amaya in this release. This version of Amaya does
not include the compilers (this will be done in the next release).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
To compile Amaya, we have first to compile the libwww project which provides
different dynamic (.DLL) and static (.LIB) libraries corresponding to
different protocols (http, ftp, etc.). Then we have to compile lib jpeg,
libz/libpng and Thot library. Finally we can compile Amaya application by
including in its workspace project C files in the Thot/amaya directory, all
the static libraries provided by the libwww, libjpeg.lib, libpng.lib and
LibThotEditor.lib. This release includes make files for libwww, thot library
and Amaya application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
To execute Amaya, move all the dynamic libraries (www*.dll) provided after
compiling libwww in the directory containing amaya.exe file</p>
<p>
Some of Amaya features are not yet supported under Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Printing, 
<li>
CSS dialogue (amaya supports of course CSS but the the item CSS in the menu
styles is not connected). 
<li>
Spell checking (the dialogue already exists but it is not connected), 
<li>
Plugins, 
<li>
Client side image maps. 
</ul>
<p>
All these features will be available in the next release.</p>
