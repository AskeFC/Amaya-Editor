<h1>Compiling Amaya On Windows NT</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">
This release of Amaya running on Windows NT  and  95 is developed with MSVC++.
The project workspace is completely different than the Makefile delivered for
Unix platforms. For example, we cannot run the compilers app, str, prs from
the project workspace.</p>
<p>
First you have to download additional files needed to build amaya on Windows
from <a href="../Distribution/amaya-compil-1.3a.ZIP">here</a>. Put both the
source tar file and the additional files in the same directory and unzip them
(use a Win32 tool to unzip files).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
if you use the MSVC++ 4.x,, different components of Amaya project workspace
have to be compiled independently. These components are: libwww, the Thot
library, libjpeg, libpng (with libz) and the Amaya application. If yopu are
using MSVC++ 5.0 you have to dowload amaya project and build it. It includes
all other sub-worspaces. This version of Amaya does not include the compilers
(this will be done in the next release).</p>
