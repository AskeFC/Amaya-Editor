        <p>'Remove strong: (strong{*+}); { * &gt; :*; }' (1).</p>

        <p>- But if I try to generalize it like this:</p>

        <p>'Remove element: (elm:*{*+}); { * &gt; :*; }' (2)</p>

        <p>it removes instead the parent element.</p>

        <p>- If I have the structure text:strong:p:body, (1) removes strong
        correctly, while (2) removes p.</p>

        <p>Of course I could rewrite (1) for any possible tag but I believe
        there must be an easier way.</p>
