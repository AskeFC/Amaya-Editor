<h1>Activating a Link</h1>

<p>Links are normally displayed as blue or underlined text. Because Amaya is
both a browser and an editor, you get different results when you
single-click, double-click, or right-click a link.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Single-click a link to move the cursor to that position in the
    document. The status bar displays the expanded URI of the link. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Double-click a link to activate the link and go to its target. The
    document retrieved by this operation replaces the current document in the
    same window and in the same mode (editor or browser) as the original
    document. If the original document was modified and has not yet been
    saved, a "Lose all modifications" prompt displays. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Right-click a link to activate the link and open the target document in
    a new window. The original document remains open in the first window. 
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This behavior can be changed through the
    <strong>General Preferences</strong> dialog. By changing the
    <strong>Double click activates link</strong> option, you can browse
    documents with a simple click as you would in a traditional Web browser.
    However, you will not be able to edit a link by clicking within it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
