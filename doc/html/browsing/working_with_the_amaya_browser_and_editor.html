<h1>Working with the Amaya Browser and Editor</h1>

<p>You can use Amaya to <a href="opening_documents.html">open</a> and browse
local and remote Web documents. You can also use it to create and modify Web
pages.</p>

<h2>Browsing versus editing</h2>

<p>Browsing with Amaya is similar to browsing with other Web browsers. For
example, the Amaya button bar includes stop, back, next, refresh, home, save,
and print buttons. There is one important difference: you double-click a link
to activate it. See <a href="activating_a_link.html">Activating a Link</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>Unlike other browsers, Amaya also provides tools for editing web pages.
See these topics for more information on editing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../Changing.html">Editing Documents</a></li>
  <li><a href="../Tables.html">Editing Tables</a></li>
  <li><a href="../Math.html">Editing Mathematics</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Editor mode and browser mode</h2>

<p>By default, Amaya begins in editor mode. In this mode, you can edit the
current document as well as browse in the window.</p>

<p>The button bar displays the <img src="../icons/Editor.gif"
alt="Editor button"> button when the window is in editor mode. The button bar
displays the <img src="../icons/browser.gif" alt="Browser Button"> button
when the window is in browser mode. In this mode, you can only browse and
fill in forms.</p>

<p>To toggle the window from editor mode to browser mode, click the <img
src="../icons/Editor.gif" alt="Editor button"> button. Click the <img
src="../icons/browser.gif" alt="Browser Button"> button to return to editor
mode. You can also select this mode by choosing <strong>Editor Mode</strong>
from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, or by using a keyboard shortcut (the
default is <code>Shift-Control-*</code>).</p>

<p class="Note"><b>Note</b>: You can set the mode independently for each
document window.</p>

<h2>Character Sets</h2>

<p>Amaya reads HTML and XHTML documents differently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Amaya reads HTML documents by default as <a
    href="../editing_iso-latin-1_characters/entering_ISOLatin1_characters_in_amaya.html">ISO-latin-1</a>
    files. If an author does not provide information about the character set
    (charset) in the HTTP header or in a META element, Amaya considers an
    HTML document to be encoded in ISO-Latin-1.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Amaya reads XHTML documents by default as UTF 8 files. If an author
    does not provide information about the charset in the HTTP header, in the
    XML declaration, or in a META element, Amaya considers an XHTML document
    to be encoded in UTF 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the default charset is different for HTML and XHTML documents,
authors often create documents using the incorrect charset. For example,
consider an XHTML document that uses ISO-Latin-1 but does not provide
information about the charset. When the XML parser analyzing the document
encounters a character that does not match a valid UTF 8 character, the
document is considered to be invalid. The parsing stops and Amaya displays an
error message. Amaya then activates the <strong>Reopen in
ISO-latin-1</strong> option on the <strong>File</strong> menu. Choose this
option to set the document's charset to ISO-Latin-1 and reopen the document
so it can be properly parsed. Amaya considers the reopened document to be
modified (because a charset was added) and you can save it.</p>
