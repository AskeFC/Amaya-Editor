<h1>Accessibility in Amaya</h1>

<p>The Amaya user population is extremely diverse. In addition to speaking a
variety of languages and operating on several platforms, the population
contains users with visual, aural, and motor disabilities.</p>

<p>Because Amaya is an Open Source project, it is important to produce
documents that are accessible to all members of the user base. Amaya provides
a number of accessibility features to assist you with achieving this goal.</p>

<p>For more information on accessibility, see:</p>
