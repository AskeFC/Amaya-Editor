<h1>Working with Graphics</h1>

<p>Amaya enables you to
include vector graphics in Web pages, following the Scalable Vector Graphics
(SVG) specification.</p>

<p>Amaya handles SVG
elements as structured components, in the same way as HTML elements. Therefore,
you can manipulate SVG graphics in the same way you manipulate other parts of
HTML documents.</p>

<p>All editing commands
provided by Amaya for handling text are also available for handling graphics.
In addition, Amaya includes some additional commands for entering SVG elements.</p>
