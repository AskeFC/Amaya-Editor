<h1>About Merging Elements</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">You can merge successive elements, even if they are not
at the same level in the document structure, by using the
<code>Backspace</code> and <code>Delete</code> keys. When the insertion point
is at the end of an element, use the <code>Delete</code> key to merge; when
it is at the beginning of an element, use the <code>Backspace</code> key. In
both cases, these keys do not delete any characters; instead they merge
elements previously separated by a structure boundary.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Note that when the insertion point iswithin an element,
the <code>Backspace</code> and <code>Delete</code> keys delete the next or
previous character as usual.</p>
