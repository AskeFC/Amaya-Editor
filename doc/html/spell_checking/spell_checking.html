<h1>Spell Checking</h1>

<p>Amaya provides a multilingual spell checker, and selects the appropriate
language according to the LANG attribute. The LANG attribute can be
associated with any element in a document, even with a single word, by using
the Language command in the Attributes menu.</p>

<p>To spell check a document, choose the Spell Check command from the Edit
menu.</p>

<h2>The Personal Dictionary</h2>

<p>When you register a new word, the spell checker creates or updates the
"user's personal dictionary. The "user's personal dictionary" is located in
the AmayaHome/dictionary.DCT. In read-write mode, the spell checker will use,
in addition to the language-specific dictionary, the user dictionary to
control all documents. This dictionary is created and automatically updated
by the spelling checker when the commands Skip (+dic) and Replace (+dic)' are
issued.</p>

<h2>The Spell Check Dialog</h2>

<p>The Spell Check command in Edit menu displays a form that enables you to
choose the parameters and to interact with the checker. These parameters are
defined below.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Number of proposals</strong>area defines the maximum number of
    proposals: any value between 1 and 10, the default value is 3. Once an
    error has been detected, any change made to this value immediately
    displays a new list of proposals.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Ignore</strong> submenu makes the spell checker ignore
    certain words. For example, words that contain capital letters, digits,
    Roman numerals or special characters, etc.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Checking</strong> submenu, similar to that in the Search
    form, allows you to specify the part of document on which the checker
    will work.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Spell Checking</strong> area displays incorrect words. The
    list of proposals is displayed in the selector located below the
    incorrect word. By default, the first proposal of correction is selected.
    To select another proposal, simply click on it. The selected proposal is
    displayed below the selector. This proposal can be directly modified in
    the form. Thecorrection is made once you have clicked on one of the
    buttons Replace and nextor Replace (+dic).</li>
  <li>The <strong>language</strong> in which the correction is made is
    specified in the top left corner of the form. To change the language,
    just apply an attribute Language to the text concerned by using the
    Attributes menu and restart the correction procedure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running the Spell Checker</h2>

<p>To start the correction, click on the Search/Skip button bottom of the
form. If an error is found, the incorrect word is selected and highlighted in
the document. If no error has been detected, the "Not found" message is
displayed in the bottom right corner of the form.</p>

<p>When an incorrect word is detected, you can then use one of the buttons
placed at the bottom of the form to perform one of the following
operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Done</strong>: The form disappears and checking is aborted.
    Previous corrections are not canceled.</li>
  <li><strong>Search/Skip</strong>: The word considered incorrect is
    acceptable. No change is made in the text nor in the dictionaries. The
    checker searches for the next error.</li>
  <li><strong>Skip+Next</strong>: The word considered incorrect is
    acceptable, and the checker moves on to the next word.</li>
  <li><strong>Skip (+dic)</strong>: Same action as Skip+Next button, except
    that the word considered incorrect is added to the spelling dictionary
    specific to the document, thus the checker will ignore any subsequent
    occurrence of this word.</li>
  <li><strong>Replace and Next</strong>: the word considered as erroneous is
    replaced by the correct word (changed or modified by the user, see above)
    and the checker searches for the next error.</li>
  <li><strong>Replace (+dic):</strong> Same as <strong>Replace and
    Next</strong>, except that the replacement word is added to the document
    dictionary.</li>
</ul>
