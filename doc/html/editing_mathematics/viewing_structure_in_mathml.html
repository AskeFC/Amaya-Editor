<h1>Viewing Structure in MathML</h1>

<p>MathML structure in a document can be viewed by choosing <strong>Show
Structure</strong> from the <strong>Views</strong> menu. Choosing this option
opens the Structure view, which reveals the main structure of the HTML
document, the math tags, and their contents.</p>

<p>Math expressions can be edited in the main view or in the Structure
view.</p>

<h2>Viewing Structure Example</h2>

<p>The Structure view is especially helpful to avoid ambiguity. For example,
in the equation below, placing the cursor after character, “b,” it is not
clear whether you wish to add something within the square root or after
it.</p>

<p>x=a+b+1</p>

<p>Selecting (or checking) in the Structure view avoids any misselections.
You can also check the status line at the bottom of the main window.</p>
