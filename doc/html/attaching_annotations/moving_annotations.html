<h1>Moving Annotations</h1>

<p>Amaya also lets you to move an annotation to any other part of the same
document. This can be used, for example, to handle orphan and misleading
annotations. You can move an annotation to either the current selection or to
the value of a stored <span class="Link">XPointer</span>. It is only possible
to move annotations in the same document where they were created.</p>

<p>To move an annotation to a current selection:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the annotation window.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Click the annotated document and select something on it. 
    <p><\li></p>
  </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Annotation</strong> window, choose <strong>Move to
    selection</strong> from the <strong>Annotations</strong> menu.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Amaya moves the annotation icon to the text you selected and will mark
    the annotation document as modified.</li>
</ol>

<p>To make this change effective, you will have to save the annotation.
Otherwise, you will loose the change. You can also move an annotation to the
current position of the cursor, without having to make a selection.</p>

<h1>Moving Multiple Annotations</h1>

<p>You can also memorize the position where you want to move the annotation
to, and then move them there. This is useful for moving multiple annotations
to the same position or to scroll elsewhere in the document before doing the
move.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make the selection (or just place the cursor) to the location where you
    want to move the annotation.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Store selection as XPointer</strong> from the
    <strong>Link</strong> menu to internally store an XPointer that
    represents that selection.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Annotations</strong> window, choose <strong>Move to
    stored XPointer</strong> from the <strong>Annotations </strong>menu to
    move the annotation to its new location.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Save the annotation to make this change effective.</li>
