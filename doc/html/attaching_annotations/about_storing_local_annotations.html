<h1>About Storing Local Annotations</h1>

<p>Amaya can store annotation data in a local file system (often called
"local annotations") or it can store annotations <span style="color:blue"><a
href="about_storing_remote_annotations.html">remotely</a></span>, accessed
through the World Wide Web (called "remote annotations").</p>

<p>You do not need a server to create local annotations. Local annotations
are stored under the user preferences directory, in a special directory
called <strong>annotations</strong>, and can be seen only by their owner
(according to the system access right setup). This directory contains three
kinds of files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>annot.index:</strong>  Associates URLs with the files
    containing the metadata of the annotations.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>index + random suffix:</strong>  Stores the metadata of the
    annotations related to a given URL. The metadata is specified with RDF.
    <p><br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>annot + random suffix.html:</strong>  Contains the body of an
    annotation, stored as XHTML.</li>
</ul>

<p>At any time, you can convert a local annotation to a shared one by
choosing <strong>Post annotation</strong> from the
<strong>Annotations</strong> menu. Once this is completed, the local
annotation will be deleted because it will have been moved to an annotation
server.</p>
