<h1>About Synchronized Views</h1>

<p>All views except the Source view are automatically
synchronized. When you select characters or elements in one view of a document,
Amaya automatically scrolls the other views of the document to show the
selected items.</p>

<p>You can edit a document in any view. During editing, the
changes you make are displayed only in the active view. When you select a
button bar or menu command or click in another location, Amaya updates the
other views to display your changes.</p>

<p>The Source view is not automatically synchronized. After
making a series of edits in the Source view, you must choose File &gt;
Synchronize to update the other views of the document. Conversely, when you
make changes in any other view, choose File &gt; Synchronize to update the
Source view.</p>

<p>When you synchronize a document, Amaya will re-validate it.
If you introduced markup errors in the source view, Amaya will recover as well
as it can. You should check the document in the Structure or Formatted view
after editing in Source view to ensure that synchronization has done what you
expected.</p>

<p>When you save a document from the Source view or from the
Formatted view (locally or remotely), synchronization occurs automatically. All
views reflect the state of the document at the time it is saved.</p>
