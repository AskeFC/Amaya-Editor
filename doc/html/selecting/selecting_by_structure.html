<h1>Selecting by Structure</h1>

<p>The structure view is especially convenient for quickly selecting large
elements or groups of elements within a document.</p>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select an element:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the blue label that represents the element, or click the name of
    any of its attributes, or click the blue vertical line associated with
    that element. In this way, a large element like a complex table or a long
    list can be selected with a single click.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select a text character or text string within
a structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clicking a text character in Structure view selects only that
    character. To select a text string, click and drag across the desired
    text.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select an attribute value:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Structure view, attribute values that can be edited from the
    keyboard are represented in bold text. Click and drag across the
    attribute value to select it. You cannot extend this type of text
    selection outside the attribute value.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To select structure elements using the
keyboard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Press the <strong>Esc</strong> (<strong>F2</strong> on Windows) key to select the parent
    element in the document structure. Press the <strong>Esc</strong> (<strong>F2</strong> on
    Windows) key several times to select containers (and everything in them)
    up the structure towards the root.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>Ctrl+-</strong> (minus key) to select a child element.</li>
  <li>Press<strong> Ctrl+k</strong> to select the next element at the same level (or at
    the level of the parent element if there is no next/previous child of the
    current level).</li>
  <li>Press<strong> Control-j</strong> to select the previous element at the same level
    (or at the level of the parent element if there is no previous child of
    the current level).</li>
</ul>
