<h1>Selecting with Keyboard and Mouse</h1>

<p>Many commands in Amaya act on the current selection. You can make a
selection using the keyboard or the mouse, as described below.</p>

<p>However you make the current selection, Amaya displays the type of the
first selected element at the bottom of the window, followed by the types of
the enclosing elements in the structure. This may be helpful when the
document structure is complex.</p>

<h2>Selecting with the mouse</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To move the insertion point, click with the left mouse button.</li>
  <li>To select sometext, “drag” across a region: hold down the left mouse
    button, move themouse, and release the button when the desired text is
    selected.</li>
  <li>To select anentire word, double-click on any character of a word.</li>
  <li>To select a wholeelement such as a list item, click its bullet or
    number.</li>

    down the Shiftkey.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selecting from the keyboard</h2>

    Alt-Enter. If the selectionis within a link, Alt-Enter will activate the
