<h1>About Linking External and User Style Sheets</h1>

<p>A document can link to several external style sheets that are downloaded
with the document and applied to it.</p>

<p>One external style sheet can apply to multiple documents. When the same
style sheet applies to several displayed documents, Amaya loads only one
instance of the style sheet.</p>

<p>Any user can define a specific style sheet that applies to all documents
loaded on their system. This style sheet is called the user's style sheet. It
is stored in the user's local environment, in the <span
class="Link0">AmayaHome directory</span> as the local file amaya.css.</p>

<p>For example, if you prefer to display documents in Helvetica on your
screen and print them in small size, you can create a User's style sheet with
following CSS rules:</p>

<p><code>@media print {<br>
        BODY {font-size: 10pt}<br>
        }<br>
@media screen {<br>
        BODY {font-family: Helvetica}<br>
        }</code></p>
</body>
