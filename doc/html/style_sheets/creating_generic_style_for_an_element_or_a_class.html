<h1>Creating a Generic Style for an Element or Class</h1>

<p>When a style attribute is associated with an element, you can use that
element as a model for creating or modifying a style rule by using the Create
Rule command.</p>

<h2>Using the Create Rule Command</h2>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To create a generic style for an element or
class:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the element you wish to use as the template.
    <p></p>
    <p class="StepNote"><strong>Note:</strong> You must select only one
    element and this element must have a style attribute.</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Choose <b>Create Rule</b> from the Style menu.</li>
  <li>A dialog displaying a list of CSS selectors will open. This list
    comprises all classes that are defined for the current document, as well
    as the element type to which the style is associated.</li>
  <li>Choose a selector in this list or enter a new class name and press the
    Confirm button. The style of the selected element is then associated with
    the chosen selector and the style attribute is removed from the selected
    element.Its content is moved to the STYLE element, in the document HEAD,
    and all elements matching the selector are displayed with the new
  style.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Associating Classes with Elements</h2>

<p>When you have created new classes with the Create Rule command, you can
associate these classes with some elements in the document.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Apply Class from the Style menu.</li>
<li>A dialog box pops up which displays all existing classes. Choose one of these classes.</li>
<li>The selected elements are then displayed with the style associated with the chosen class. </li>
</ol>

<p>To associate a class with an element, you can also use the Attributes
menu. This menu also allows you to delete a class attribute from an element
or to change it: the class attribute is handled like any other attribute.</p>
