<h1>Handling External CSS Style Sheets</h1>

<p>The entry Style Sheets gives access to a set of commands which allows you
to control external and User's preference CSS style sheets:</p>

<p>The command Link allows you to link a new CSS style sheet to the current
document. You can click directly the target style sheet if it is already
displayed in a Amaya window. In other cases you should click in the current
document to get a dialog box and type the target style sheet's URI. This
command adds an element link with its attributes into the head of the
document.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Open</strong> allows one to open one of the CSS style sheets
    applied to the current document.</li>
  <li><strong>Disable</strong> allows one to remove effects of one of the
    enabled CSS style sheets to the current document. This command doesn't
    affect the CSS link in the document.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable</strong> reapplies effects of one of the disabled CSS
    style sheets to the current document. This command doesn't affect the CSS
    link in the document.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove</strong> removes one of the external CSS style sheets.
    This command acts as the Disable command but in addition to that the
    element link which attaches the external CSS style sheet is removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commands <strong>Open</strong>, <strong>Disable</strong> and
<strong>Enable</strong> can be applied to the User's preference style sheet,
but commands Link and Remove concern only linked CSS style sheets. The
following figure shows the list of CSS style sheets proposed for the command
Open. If no CSS style sheet is currently applied to a document, a dialog box
explains that there is "No CSS file available"</p>
