<h2 style="text-align : right; color : #BEBEBE">Release 1.3a</h2>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> is a Web client that acts both as a browser and as an
authoring tool. It has been designed with the primary purpose of demonstrating
new Web technologies in a WYSIWYG environment. The current version implements
HTML, MathML, CSS, and HTTP.</p>

<h3>Main Features</h3>
<p>
With Amaya, you can manipulate rich Web pages containing forms, tables and the
most advanced features from HTML. You can create and edit complex mathematical
expressions within Web pages. You can style your documents using Cascading
Style Sheets. You can publish documents on local or remote servers with the
HTTP Put method.</p>
<p>
Browsing and authoring are integrated seamlessly. You can browse and edit Web
pages at the same time. For that reason, a simple click just moves the caret
to allow text editing; to follow a link, you have to double click.</p>

<h3>Online Manual</h3>
<p>
A User' Manual is available on line. You can browse it with the Help menu,
which displays each section separately.  You can also print it: just follow
the <a href="../doc/amaya/Manual.html">Online Manual</a> link below. You'll
get the front page. Then build the whole book with the "Make book" entry from
the Special menu and print the result.</p>
